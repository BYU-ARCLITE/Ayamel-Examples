02:16.122 --> 02:17.793
What I'm doing is no good.

3
02:35.865 --> 02:38.016
I wanted to keep some for you,
but then I thought you did not want any.

4
02:38.242 --> 02:40.074
Had I known you wanted some,
you know me...

5
02:54.879 --> 02:58.314
I know I didn't collect much,
but there's no lily of the valley around here.

6
02:58.718 --> 03:00.310
Or maybe just some scrawny ones...

7
03:02.740 --> 03:04.331
Garris, wait!

8
03:06.213 --> 03:08.728
-You're a real bastard.
-I didn't want, I swear!

9
03:08.955 --> 03:11.834
You could at least have kept the bottle,
it was returnable.

10
03:11.881 --> 03:14.395
-I'll go back to get it.
-No, it's almost 12.

11
03:15.538 --> 03:16.765
Don't walk so fast.

12
03:22.301 --> 03:23.417
You need a lift?

13
03:23.580 --> 03:24.854
Thanks, we won't say no.

14
03:25.044 --> 03:26.635
For sure, we won't say no.

15
03:35.646 --> 03:37.000
How old are you, son?

16
03:37.841 --> 03:38.909
35.

17
03:39.121 --> 03:41.588
My son would be your age,
had he not died at Verdun.

18
03:43.691 --> 03:45.169
Were you in the war too?

19
03:46.799 --> 03:47.753
What's the matter?

20
03:47.895 --> 03:50.364
-My friend does not like that.
-Like what?

21
03:50.638 --> 03:52.707
Like to speak of that bloody war.

22
03:56.122 --> 03:58.114
What are you going to do with all these lilies?

23
03:58.317 --> 04:00.546
Sell it. Tomorrow is May 1st.

24
04:00.693 --> 04:04.651
People complain life is expensive,
and they buy flowers...

25
04:04.715 --> 04:05.750
For all you know,

26
04:05.995 --> 04:09.111
your lilies will make you more money than my potatoes.

27
04:09.286 --> 04:11.355
Lilies bring luck,
potatoes don't.

28
04:15.135 --> 04:16.888
Thanks, you can drop us here.

29
04:22.813 --> 04:25.885
-Thanks for your trouble
-See you.

30
04:53.710 --> 04:56.064
Your Pamela is gone,
stop thinking about her.

31
04:57.366 --> 04:58.322
Come on

32
04:58.463 --> 05:00.182
Don't torture yourself; what's the use.

33
05:01.571 --> 05:03.288
We must be in a good mood tonight.

34
05:03.764 --> 05:06.199
We're not going to sing "De Profundis"!

35
05:07.055 --> 05:08.045
You're right.

36
05:08.517 --> 05:12.033
We'll sing 'May' and make 100 francs more than last year.

37
05:14.369 --> 05:15.437
Let's go

38
05:22.047 --> 05:24.800
Shit! Shit! Shit!

39
05:26.252 --> 05:28.322
I told you a 100 times
to stop this.

40
05:28.446 --> 05:29.764
But there's a wasp hive!

41
05:29.908 --> 05:32.024
I don't care! Beat it!

42
05:33.382 --> 05:36.930
Cri-Cri, don't dirty your dress.
I've already washed it twice this week.

43
05:42.704 --> 05:46.663
I've always wondered why my first memories
are of that particular spring.

44
05:46.910 --> 05:48.946
Must be the same for everyone.

45
05:49.103 --> 05:50.980
You have memories of before, of course...

46
05:51.115 --> 05:52.468
How are you, little girl?

47
05:52.759 --> 05:56.435
...but you're too young, they are only fragments,
scattered images.

48
05:56.964 --> 05:59.274
Then, when you are 4 or 5,

49
05:59.524 --> 06:02.197
suddenly, it's like you really exist.

50
06:02.814 --> 06:04.725
Everything stays with you forever.

51
06:04.826 --> 06:07.658
Many years later,

52
06:08.300 --> 06:10.370
you can tell it like a story.

53
06:10.675 --> 06:12.394
I was about to turn 5.

54
06:12.687 --> 06:14.916
Very few lilies, huh

55
06:16.891 --> 06:17.927
Garris!

56
06:17.988 --> 06:21.298
Your friend with the big bicycle came
and left a roast chicken on the table.

57
06:21.461 --> 06:23.338
-Can we have some?
-Shut up.

58
06:23.473 --> 06:26.305
He also said that if you are ok with it,
he'll go sing with you.

59
06:26.581 --> 06:27.809
My goodness!

60
06:27.860 --> 06:31.536
If Am�d�e comes along, they won't throw coins,
they'll throw buckets of water instead!

61
06:34.807 --> 06:36.365
Bloody Am�d�e...

62
06:36.636 --> 06:37.591
Such a nice guy.

63
06:37.733 --> 06:41.521
-So can we have some chicken?
-Yes, yes, you'll get your chicken.

64
06:41.754 --> 06:42.709
Go!

65
06:43.583 --> 06:46.177
In life, to have what you want,
you must work.

66
06:46.507 --> 06:48.225
Never forget that.

67
06:49.250 --> 06:51.048
Either that, or steal from people.

68
06:51.262 --> 06:54.538
And me, Henry Pignolle, I don't want my children
to become thieves.

69
06:54.918 --> 06:56.509
Understood?

70
06:56.745 --> 06:57.656
Well said, right?

71
06:57.843 --> 07:00.754
Not bad. Read it in your book
or came up with it on your own?

72
07:00.951 --> 07:02.144
On my own.

73
07:02.596 --> 07:06.668
In my book it says: "Never force your children to work,

74
07:06.800 --> 07:08.392
otherwise they may get used to it"

75
07:10.091 --> 07:12.560
Our father ever read only one book

76
07:12.651 --> 07:16.165
an old almanach from 1921
he used to go through constantly,

77
07:16.307 --> 07:17.661
He knew it by heart.

78
07:20.877 --> 07:23.028
Let's go kids, your mother will worry.

79
07:23.254 --> 07:24.209
Jojo!

80
07:25.447 --> 07:26.358
Take this.

81
07:27.276 --> 07:29.153
Give her this one, tell her it's from your father

82
07:29.288 --> 07:31.040
-And from you too?
-If you want...

83
07:34.040 --> 07:36.874
At times I ask myself why I've stayed here 12 years.

84
07:38.610 --> 07:40.680
Listening to the devil that prevents me from leaving.

85
07:41.901 --> 07:43.334
-I don't understand.
-Is that so?

86
07:43.730 --> 07:46.324
What about me? What about the kids?
What would become of us?

87
07:46.471 --> 07:47.824
You're not gonna leave us, right, Garris?

88
07:51.408 --> 07:52.726
You're not gonna leave us.

89
08:01.463 --> 08:02.781
You're not feeling well?

90
08:02.925 --> 08:05.678
No... not too good.

91
08:05.850 --> 08:08.045
Don't stay out in the cold,
come inside.

92
08:25.961 --> 08:27.279
I cast some lines

93
08:27.605 --> 08:30.564
in the pond.
They need to be reeled in.

94
08:30.713 --> 08:32.385
I'll go. Where are they?

95
08:32.908 --> 08:34.579
The dog will guide you.

96
08:35.101 --> 08:36.329
Go, doggie.

97
09:05.998 --> 09:08.307
Good, you have something?

98
09:09.836 --> 09:11.065
Nice eel.

99
09:13.676 --> 09:15.586
Put it in the back.

100
09:16.966 --> 09:18.639
You can sell it if you want.

101
09:19.342 --> 09:21.061
You'll get good money for it.

102
09:21.172 --> 09:23.082
No, we'll eat it tomorrow.

103
09:23.730 --> 09:25.369
You need to regain our strength

104
09:26.107 --> 09:27.381
I don't know how to gut it

105
09:27.570 --> 09:30.447
I'll show you how, if you stay for a while.

106
09:32.323 --> 09:34.553
2 or 3 days.
I'll leave once you feel better.

107
09:35.066 --> 09:38.501
But I am not sick!
I have never once been sick my entire life!

108
09:39.452 --> 09:41.727
I'm 92, that's all.

109
09:41.830 --> 09:43.308
That's my sickness.

110
09:43.841 --> 09:45.558
Thanks for staying.

111
09:46.217 --> 09:47.412
It's my pleasure.

112
09:48.594 --> 09:50.788
Listen, if you're hungry,

113
09:51.336 --> 09:54.293
there's bread and cheese in the cabbard.

114
09:54.443 --> 09:56.399
-Take whatever you want.
-I don't mind

115
09:59.197 --> 10:00.426
The eel...

116
10:01.025 --> 10:02.618
there's too much for two of us.

117
10:04.316 --> 10:06.750
Tomorrow you'll go and give half to Riton

118
10:07.423 --> 10:08.413
Who is Riton?

119
10:09.070 --> 10:12.460
A guy who lives a bit further,
in the other hut.

120
10:14.370 --> 10:16.839
His wife is never in a hurry to cook

121
10:18.211 --> 10:20.725
Always combing her hair,

122
10:21.135 --> 10:22.615
pampering herself,

123
10:22.964 --> 10:24.363
a vain one.

124
10:24.792 --> 10:26.543
Poor Riton!

125
10:26.802 --> 10:28.634
He's happy like that.

126
10:30.642 --> 10:34.111
Every morning, as long as he can look
at his Pamela,

127
10:34.663 --> 10:36.062
all is well.

128
10:39.600 --> 10:41.272
Where do you come from?

129
10:42.159 --> 10:43.912
I got my army release in February.

130
10:45.999 --> 10:47.477
You've been walking ever since?

131
10:48.923 --> 10:49.879
To go where?

132
10:50.751 --> 10:53.186
I don't know.
Here and there.

133
10:54.774 --> 10:55.729
It's a beautiful country.

134
10:59.527 --> 11:01.802
But one day, you have to settle down.

135
11:03.365 --> 11:04.355
Here...

136
11:05.011 --> 11:06.764
you'd be good, you'd be free.

137
11:06.840 --> 11:09.751
No need to sleep in other people's houses

138
11:10.312 --> 11:13.066
I'll leave you my hut,
and my boat.

139
11:13.604 --> 11:15.322
The swamp...

140
11:15.798 --> 11:19.187
can still feed a man for a long time.

141
11:20.368 --> 11:23.086
I always had all I needed here

142
11:24.755 --> 11:27.428
Never been the servant of anyone

143
12:07.169 --> 12:08.761
She left me!

144
12:14.116 --> 12:15.390
Pam�la

145
12:15.578 --> 12:17.011
She left.

146
12:19.052 --> 12:20.008
Where's the old man?

147
12:21.611 --> 12:23.169
He left too.

148
12:44.464 --> 12:47.297
Come on, it's getting late.
Let's not make Am�d�e wait.

149
13:04.756 --> 13:06.110
I'm coming!

150
13:07.134 --> 13:08.283
Let's get moving.

151
13:08.413 --> 13:10.210
Your sister gives me the creeps.

152
13:10.972 --> 13:12.725
Come, Come. You know...

153
13:13.167 --> 13:15.806
Ad�le is not mean, just a bit mad that's all.

154
13:16.274 --> 13:19.822
Her fianc� Bruno went off to war in 1916,
never came back.

155
13:20.479 --> 13:24.073
Since then everytime someone walks in front of the house,
she thinks he's back.

156
13:35.836 --> 13:38.873
One sec, one of my feet is killing me.

157
13:40.405 --> 13:41.475
Shit!

158
13:45.524 --> 13:46.480
Feeling better?

159
13:47.902 --> 13:49.893
Yes, feels good.

160
13:51.375 --> 13:54.287
Tell me, Am�d�e,
may I ask you a question?

161
13:54.666 --> 13:56.782
Nothing's indiscreet between us.

162
13:59.418 --> 14:01.727
Your father and you,
how long since you stopped talking to each other?

163
14:02.893 --> 14:04.245
5 or 6 years.

164
14:04.721 --> 14:08.793
But since he hardly spoke before, except to criticise me,
not a big loss.

165
14:08.926 --> 14:11.315
That's not what I'm after.
Why is it you don't talk to each other anymore?

166
14:13.130 --> 14:15.008
A stupid quarrel.

167
14:16.238 --> 14:18.034
I'll tell you one day.

168
14:19.894 --> 14:22.852
Where are you planning to sing 'the May song'

169
14:23.003 --> 14:23.913
to the people this year?

170
14:24.282 --> 14:25.192
Around here.

171
14:26.293 --> 14:28.169
You mean in my neighborhood?

172
14:32.326 --> 14:34.634
In that case,
I really cannot join you.

173
14:35.250 --> 14:37.287
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

174
14:37.994 --> 14:39.393
Let's go, Riton.

175
14:40.187 --> 14:42.860
You know, we come here
because people are rich.

176
14:43.113 --> 14:46.149
We did not think it would cause you
a problem of pride.

177
14:47.317 --> 14:48.635
of  dignity.

178
14:49.327 --> 14:50.397
The rich are not the ones giving most.

179
14:52.071 --> 14:53.708
The rich give to get rid of us

180
14:53.716 --> 14:56.355
They prefer if we yell elsewhere,
get on other people's nerves.

181
14:56.823 --> 14:57.778
Let's go.

182
15:00.297 --> 15:01.331
Listen, Am�d�e.

183
15:01.942 --> 15:04.331
I'm telling you it's no bother,
we know you're a friend.

184
15:04.501 --> 15:06.298
By the way, we didn't
even thank you for the chicken.

185
15:06.330 --> 15:08.684
Ah yes, that chicken was really delicious.

186
15:09.072 --> 15:10.346
It's nothing.

187
15:10.534 --> 15:11.729
Listen,

188
15:12.363 --> 15:14.479
may I offer some advice?

189
15:14.557 --> 15:17.548
If you pass by the bank manager's house,
avoid it, he's a real mean one.

190
15:18.761 --> 15:21.480
You'll recognise it easily,
a big white house.

191
15:21.687 --> 15:22.596
He hates noise.

192
15:22.783 --> 15:26.493
He's got a 2-meter-tall black butler

193
15:26.806 --> 15:28.443
A mean Senegalese nicknamed Banania.

194
15:28.817 --> 15:30.693
A negro? I don't like that.

195
15:30.827 --> 15:33.466
Let's go. At night all men are black.

196
15:33.936 --> 15:35.573
Daddy is doing the horse.

197
15:39.236 --> 15:40.431
Daddy does the dog.

198
16:05.379 --> 16:09.611
Here comes the beautiful month of May,

199
16:11.596 --> 16:16.225
when gallant men plant the May seeds,

200
16:17.263 --> 16:23.532
I will plant one just for my love,

201
16:23.662 --> 16:27.575
It will be prettier than...

202
16:29.145 --> 16:30.056
Shut up, Shut up!

203
16:30.243 --> 16:31.562
And now, beat it!

204
16:31.523 --> 16:33.195
1 Franc! Deserves a second song.

205
16:33.350 --> 16:35.182
No, no, for Christ sake.
I'm paying you to shut up.

206
16:35.727 --> 16:36.716
Give him his money back.

207
16:37.008 --> 16:38.759
No, keep it. Please understand,

208
16:38.836 --> 16:40.474
my baby just went to sleep; I'm alone.

209
16:40.663 --> 16:42.541
My wife went to her grandfather's funeral.

210
16:42.857 --> 16:44.974
Ah, that's why. We apologize.

211
16:45.234 --> 16:46.951
Thanks. We hope the little one will sleep well.

212
16:47.062 --> 16:48.461
Yes, me too.

213
16:48.707 --> 16:51.017
Good bye. Good night.

214
16:51.083 --> 16:52.914
Good. I close the gate.

215
16:59.311 --> 17:01.062
Let's go

216
17:02.601 --> 17:04.637
-One, Two,..
-Just one sec.

217
17:04.979 --> 17:07.971
I'd like to let you know that you don't
emphasize 'May' enough.

218
17:08.269 --> 17:11.625
-What do you mean?
-We sing May, so you must stress 'May'.

219
17:12.840 --> 17:17.788
Here comes the beautiful
month of May. May....

220
17:19.054 --> 17:20.090
Agreed?

221
17:22.163 --> 17:23.152
Anybody there?

222
17:23.442 --> 17:25.512
Apologies madam.
We came to sing May.

223
17:25.636 --> 17:28.947
That's very good.
That's a fading tradition.

224
17:29.110 --> 17:31.577
Please sing ahead. It brings luck.

225
17:34.046 --> 17:38.324
Here comes the beautiful month of May.

226
17:38.433 --> 17:41.664
It's true it's May already.
How time flies!

227
17:41.907 --> 17:45.183
-Keep quiet and listen.

228
17:46.112 --> 17:50.025
They're dragging too much on 'May'
In my day we did not sing it that way.

229
17:50.317 --> 17:51.635
Keep quiet and listen.

230
18:00.372 --> 18:02.363
Do you have anything?
We got no small change.

231
18:02.566 --> 18:04.477
Never mind, you'll give next year.

232
18:04.576 --> 18:05.770
If we're still around.

233
18:06.038 --> 18:08.472
You can pay us in kindl.

234
18:08.598 --> 18:10.270
What a great idea.

235
18:10.976 --> 18:13.968
3 eggs and a bottle of good wine. Good.

236
18:14.083 --> 18:16.721
This is bad manners. What will they think of us?
Dtop drinking.

237
18:16.826 --> 18:18.338
I'm clearing my voice.

238
18:18.471 --> 18:20.426
Yeah, right. Drunkard.

239
18:22.675 --> 18:24.666
Look, an open gate - this is strange.

240
18:27.795 --> 18:29.068
Looks like no one is in

241
18:30.354 --> 18:31.833
-Let's take a look.
-Stop it.

242
18:31.999 --> 18:34.273
-Don't be an idiot
-Comne on.

243
18:35.472 --> 18:36.622
It's open.

244
18:46.259 --> 18:47.612
What is this all about?

245
18:47.904 --> 18:49.497
You must have left a light on.

246
18:49.732 --> 18:51.451
Impossible, I never forget.

247
18:51.926 --> 18:53.723
They would deduct from my salary,
they've done it before.

248
18:53.755 --> 18:55.346
Maybe your bosses are back.

249
18:55.583 --> 18:57.061
No, not until Tuesday.

250
18:59.788 --> 19:01.506
I must go. It's almost 12.

251
19:01.615 --> 19:02.651
Maybe there are thieves?

252
19:02.895 --> 19:04.328
Have you seen thieves in those parts?

253
19:05.271 --> 19:06.182
Listen, Marie.

254
19:06.551 --> 19:08.109
I ran off to come see you.

255
19:08.380 --> 19:10.814
If I'm not back before 12,
I'll be found out.

256
19:11.488 --> 19:12.840
Say good-bye, please!

257
19:14.413 --> 19:15.323
Goo-bye, please.

258
19:23.554 --> 19:24.542
Stop!

259
19:25.199 --> 19:26.188
Stay away from me!

260
19:27.027 --> 19:29.665
Don't be afraid, Miss.
Let me explain.

261
19:31.962 --> 19:33.759
We were about to leave.

262
19:33.973 --> 19:35.487
Right, Garris?

263
19:36.167 --> 19:38.442
Your manners.
Hat off in front of a lady.

264
19:39.093 --> 19:40.002
Sorry.

265
19:40.739 --> 19:43.207
We were passing by, we saw the gate wide open;

266
19:43.480 --> 19:45.836
it seemed strange so we came in to investigate,

267
19:46.405 --> 19:47.316
You understand?

268
19:48.599 --> 19:51.067
My friend and I are singing the May
in the neighborhood tonight,

269
19:51.525 --> 19:52.923
to bring people luck.

270
19:53.353 --> 19:55.070
That's as simple as that.

271
19:56.095 --> 19:58.972
I remind you that you must take your hat off
in front of a lady.

272
19:59.202 --> 20:01.353
I am not a lady,
I am the maid.

273
20:01.762 --> 20:03.594
My bosses are in Nice til Tuesday.

274
20:03.955 --> 20:05.025
They don't tell me what they're up to.

275
20:05.236 --> 20:06.463
They're not very kind to you.

276
20:06.516 --> 20:08.746
Neither kind or unkind.
They are bosses.

277
20:12.000 --> 20:13.751
You guys really gave me a good scare.

278
20:14.010 --> 20:15.046
Especially you.

279
20:15.839 --> 20:17.875
I'm sorry. Won't happen again.

280
20:18.398 --> 20:22.392
Could I have a bit of wine to ...
recover from my emotions?

281
20:22.604 --> 20:23.558
�Riton!

282
20:23.884 --> 20:25.363
-You are pushing your luck.
-But of course you can!

283
20:25.528 --> 20:28.406
The wine is mine.
I get one bottle a week but I don't drink much...

284
20:28.636 --> 20:31.390
See? Why must you always shame me
in front of people!

285
20:32.476 --> 20:33.703
Glasses are on top.

286
20:34.304 --> 20:37.182
Take three. Some wine will do me good tool.

287
20:38.326 --> 20:39.519
Sit down.

288
20:46.917 --> 20:49.557
-Do you live in town?
-No, the swamp.

289
20:50.940 --> 20:53.453
If you were to pass through,
it would be nice to come visit us.

290
20:54.413 --> 20:56.244
It's possible, why not?

291
20:57.155 --> 20:59.146
Seriously, it would make us happy.

292
21:02.275 --> 21:03.788
Have you been here for long?

293
21:04.469 --> 21:07.028
2 years.
It's my first job.

294
21:07.759 --> 21:09.239
I won't do this forever, though.

295
21:11.232 --> 21:13.144
Study, for instance.

296
21:13.426 --> 21:16.817
Por ejemplo,
asistir a unas clases.

297
21:17.449 --> 21:18.597
Become a hairdresser.

298
21:20.191 --> 21:23.228
Work in a big salon,
in a big town.

299
21:23.481 --> 21:26.440
With lots of people and buses.
Because here...

300
21:27.503 --> 21:29.300
I'd cut women's hair like Jean Harlow's

301
21:31.160 --> 21:33.594
-Do you know about Jean Harlow?
-No.

302
21:34.085 --> 21:36.121
I went to see her in a movie tonight.

303
21:36.278 --> 21:37.394
You cannot imagine.
Magnificient.

304
21:37.923 --> 21:39.277
Really magnificient.

305
21:39.752 --> 21:41.152
She's my favourite actress.

306
21:43.957 --> 21:44.866
I'm probably boring you..

307
21:45.786 --> 21:47.184
-Am I boring you?
-No.

308
21:47.431 --> 21:49.022
Not at all, on the contrary.

309
21:49.990 --> 21:50.944
Cheers!

310
21:51.086 --> 21:52.838
That's right. Cheers.

311
21:59.131 --> 22:01.008
Listen, I've had enough.

312
22:01.325 --> 22:04.920
My feet are killing me, and we're not going
to wake up people at 1am!

313
22:04.980 --> 22:06.334
That girl is real nice.

314
22:06.626 --> 22:08.140
I'm talking to you, Don Juan.

315
22:08.271 --> 22:12.059
I agree the girl is nice, and pretty,
and whatever,

316
22:12.294 --> 22:15.923
but if we don't stop now, people will not throw water
but camber pots instead.

317
22:16.133 --> 22:17.612
She promised to come see us

318
22:18.692 --> 22:21.207
Promised, promised...
She said maybe.

319
22:21.434 --> 22:23.664
-I agree with you - she'll come
-You think so?

320
22:23.811 --> 22:25.450
When a woman says 'maybe', it's for sure

321
22:25.640 --> 22:29.315
If she says 'promised', it's not even maybe,
it's never.

322
22:30.759 --> 22:33.432
-I should really read your book one of these days.
-You said it...

323
22:34.231 --> 22:35.186
How much did we make?

324
22:35.328 --> 22:38.126
I've told you 3 times already.

325
22:38.436 --> 22:40.233
87 francs and 40 cents,

326
22:40.448 --> 22:43.280
plus the eggs from the old hag.
That's how much.

327
22:44.835 --> 22:46.665
We said we would aim for at least 100 francs.

328
22:51.233 --> 22:53.827
This guy is wide awake.
Here's our opportunity.

329
22:57.633 --> 22:59.112
But it's a white house.

330
22:59.461 --> 23:01.894
-So what?
-It's the bank manager's house.

331
23:02.202 --> 23:05.000
Did you forget? The big Senegalese;
the cannibal Am�d�e told us about...

332
23:05.310 --> 23:07.301
I've known many Senegalese

333
23:07.321 --> 23:09.631
Entire regiments of them,
and I've never met a cannibal.

334
23:10.430 --> 23:12.500
Or maybe my mind was elsewhere.
Come on

335
23:21.946 --> 23:24.414
See, the banker is just like me;
his feet are killing him.

336
23:25.055 --> 23:26.044
Philosophe!

337
23:26.335 --> 23:28.086
My slippers, my medecine, my camomile tea...

338
23:28.528 --> 23:31.964
Here, sir. I've waited a long time for sir,
ready to intervene.

339
23:32.001 --> 23:35.232
What a lousy night! 3 hours standing,
ancient foie-gras,

340
23:35.476 --> 23:37.671
tepid champagne,
wrinkled old hags...

341
23:37.852 --> 23:39.410
I'm exhausted, Philosophe.

342
23:39.498 --> 23:40.407
Poor sir.

343
23:41.509 --> 23:43.545
Wear your slippers, you will feel better.

344
23:46.627 --> 23:48.823
What on earth is this circus?

345
23:51.747 --> 23:54.500
Out, get off my property!

346
23:54.672 --> 23:55.661
Beat it!

347
23:55.768 --> 23:58.281
Are you mad? What's wrong with you?

348
23:59.241 --> 24:01.836
Philosophe, get rid of this scum!
I don't want to hear them any more!

349
24:03.080 --> 24:04.069
Banania!

350
24:06.738 --> 24:10.491
Listen, my friend meant no harm.
Don't get mad, we're leaving.

351
24:10.759 --> 24:12.431
It's true, we're leaving!

352
24:12.952 --> 24:15.786
You're on your way, Mister high and mighty.

353
24:16.243 --> 24:18.678
With a big kick on your small white ass.

354
24:18.803 --> 24:20.838
You won't be able to sit down ever again.

355
24:20.997 --> 24:22.430
-Garris!
-I'm going to eat you!

356
24:22.643 --> 24:23.996
I'm going to eat you!

357
24:26.115 --> 24:27.946
Stop laughing, man.

358
24:28.675 --> 24:30.746
It's dumb to laugh at someone who's afraid.

359
24:31.234 --> 24:33.226
You must have been scared sometime too.

360
24:33.612 --> 24:36.604
Maybe scared to death for 4 years, like me.

361
24:36.902 --> 24:39.176
I was just laughing at him running his ass off.

362
24:41.472 --> 24:42.383
Please, whitey.

363
24:42.569 --> 24:43.558
5 francs. Way too much.

364
24:43.666 --> 24:47.022
My boss his paying.
I'll tell him I gave you 10.

365
24:52.625 --> 24:54.819
Marne! Vimy!

366
24:56.280 --> 24:57.349
Somme!

367
24:57.925 --> 24:58.914
What about you, man?

368
25:00.119 --> 25:01.678
Villers Cotterets, Verdun!

369
25:02.314 --> 25:03.269
The war!

370
25:05.056 --> 25:07.444
this dirty war, this shit war!

371
25:07.798 --> 25:08.708
my good man.

372
25:18.036 --> 25:20.709
He chased me almost all the way here,
but I managed to lose him.

373
25:21.326 --> 25:22.964
He didn't even go beyond the gate.

374
25:24.982 --> 25:29.260
We made 92 Francs and 40 cents. I counted again.

375
25:31.199 --> 25:32.790
Aren't those the banker's slippers?

376
25:32.844 --> 25:35.517
I'm never as dumb as people think.
That's where my strength lies.

377
25:36.683 --> 25:37.594
There,

378
25:38.328 --> 25:40.762
with the slippers we're easily over the 100 francs mark.

379
25:41.070 --> 25:43.186
Come, we've got to get some sleep.
Tomorrow morning we're selling the lilies.

380
25:44.545 --> 25:46.023
Her name is Marie.

381
25:46.921 --> 25:48.194
-Who told you?
-She did.

382
25:48.384 --> 25:51.182
I asked her. I told you,
I'm not as dumb as I look...

383
25:51.308 --> 25:52.458
This head is not empty.

384
25:59.718 --> 26:00.833
Hello, my friend!

385
26:03.923 --> 26:05.992
-How's things?
-Good, as you can see.

386
26:06.482 --> 26:08.916
If all goes well,
I'll be finished in an hour.

387
26:10.138 --> 26:11.333
Sell me some happiness.

388
26:14.344 --> 26:15.333
No, not you.

389
26:15.441 --> 26:16.839
Yes, please, it's for a gift.

390
26:17.634 --> 26:19.671
It's for an old lady I'm very fond of.

391
26:21.107 --> 26:22.904
She grows beautiful rose bushes.

392
26:23.484 --> 26:26.078
-Riton is not with you?
-He's doing the church exit.

393
26:26.958 --> 26:29.028
-Shall we see each other later?
-Whenever you want, Am�d�e.

394
26:29.335 --> 26:31.609
1'25 franc!
Happiness for the whole year!

395
26:36.098 --> 26:37.817
Look, it's Sardi, the French champion!

396
26:38.840 --> 26:39.750
How much for the lot?

397
26:40.852 --> 26:42.000
I've got to check, buddy.

398
26:42.132 --> 26:44.123
Not 'buddy'. Sir.

399
26:45.057 --> 26:46.092
Do you know who you're talking to?

400
26:46.336 --> 26:47.451
Jo Sardi. That's me.

401
26:49.078 --> 26:50.272
20 francs, ok?

402
26:50.906 --> 26:51.817
Mireille!

403
26:52.553 --> 26:53.462
Oh, Jo!

404
26:53.648 --> 26:54.876
The rest is for the people here.

405
26:55.660 --> 26:59.049
Ladies and gentlemen, a gift of happiness from Jo Sardi.

406
26:59.500 --> 27:01.569
Jo Sardi defends his title tonight.

407
27:01.875 --> 27:04.309
Come and see him fight, come on time, come in numbers

408
27:04.800 --> 27:06.279
It won't last long

409
27:06.446 --> 27:07.481
Is that ok?

410
27:09.555 --> 27:10.544
Sure, buddy.

411
27:14.125 --> 27:15.443
Everybody believes in love,

412
27:16.683 --> 27:18.321
the one that lasts forever.

413
27:20.523 --> 27:23.196
But one day you go back to your hut,

414
27:23.449 --> 27:26.042
and there you are, it's over...

415
27:26.191 --> 27:27.670
Pam�la has flown the coop.

416
27:30.029 --> 27:31.986
Thomas, hit me again - the same.

417
27:35.696 --> 27:38.086
Listen, friend, don't you think
you've had enough by now?

418
27:40.451 --> 27:41.884
No. Not enough to forget.

419
27:41.913 --> 27:43.664
I warn you, this is the last one.

420
27:44.289 --> 27:45.244
In the beginning, I thought:

421
27:46.300 --> 27:48.734
"Impossible, she'll come back".

422
27:49.042 --> 27:52.273
Cos she loved her Riton, Pam�la.

423
27:52.334 --> 27:53.288
Don't think she didn't.

424
27:53.431 --> 27:55.467
For someone who sells happiness,
he's not very cheerful...

425
27:55.624 --> 27:57.103
Jo! How are you?

426
27:57.634 --> 27:58.545
Sit down here.

427
27:58.914 --> 27:59.825
Order whatever you want.

428
28:00.194 --> 28:01.866
What will it be, Miss Mireille?

429
28:02.205 --> 28:03.240
A Suze-Cassis for me.

430
28:03.486 --> 28:04.520
For Jo, the usual.

431
28:04.765 --> 28:06.800
Suze-Cassis and Vittel-strawberry. On the way.

432
28:08.056 --> 28:11.445
Fortunately there was Garris.

433
28:11.894 --> 28:16.047
Without him, I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

434
28:16.647 --> 28:18.161
He's been a real brother to me.

435
28:18.659 --> 28:20.057
A real brother to me!

436
28:21.585 --> 28:23.973
Friend, could you keep it down a bit?

437
28:25.240 --> 28:27.674
You are disturbing a young lady.

438
28:28.165 --> 28:29.359
A young lady?

439
28:29.810 --> 28:30.880
Yes, you are disturbing a young lady indeed.

440
28:31.273 --> 28:32.183
Where is she?

441
28:32.736 --> 28:33.963
There.

442
28:44.618 --> 28:45.574
Pam�la!

443
28:46.996 --> 28:48.429
I am not Pam�la.

444
28:48.641 --> 28:49.914
You are Pam�la.

445
28:50.835 --> 28:51.744
Pam�la!

446
28:53.394 --> 28:55.226
-Leave me alone.
-My princess, my love!

447
28:55.405 --> 28:56.520
Leave me alone!

448
28:56.867 --> 28:58.346
Let go of me!
-Shit. I call you back

449
28:58.513 --> 28:59.423
Let go of me!

450
29:00.342 --> 29:01.251
Let go of me!

451
29:02.718 --> 29:03.627
You know him?

452
29:03.632 --> 29:05.030
Of course not. Can't you see he's drunk!

453
29:06.192 --> 29:08.580
Don't listent to him!

454
29:15.881 --> 29:16.996
Your ass back on that chair!

455
29:17.527 --> 29:18.436
Jo, champion!

456
29:19.172 --> 29:20.923
Felix, my Vittel-strawberry.

457
29:21.548 --> 29:22.617
Where is that peasant?

458
29:23.558 --> 29:24.958
Take that!

459
29:32.700 --> 29:34.769
Hillbilly! Hick!

460
29:35.259 --> 29:37.490
I'm gonna show you who's the hillbilly!

461
29:37.818 --> 29:39.093
Jo! Enough!

462
29:39.281 --> 29:40.681
Come on, hillbilly! Come on!

463
29:44.583 --> 29:46.221
Shit! My table!

464
29:49.884 --> 29:50.795
Not my chairs!

465
29:51.529 --> 29:52.929
Let go, I'm gonna kill him!

466
29:54.820 --> 29:56.173
Let's get the hell out of here.

467
30:00.306 --> 30:02.182
You're nothing but a peasant you are!

468
30:02.317 --> 30:03.635
Let's go. Don't run or you'll get noticed.

469
30:03.778 --> 30:05.929
My cap, I forgot my cap!

470
30:06.155 --> 30:09.192
We don't give a shit about your cap.
Walk on, we must get away from here.

471
30:09.446 --> 30:13.280
Don't give a shit? I've had it for 10 years,
and it was a gift from Pam�la.

472
30:13.286 --> 30:16.403
You are a drunk and and imbecile.
Shut up!

473
30:16.942 --> 30:18.579
I thought I saw Pam�la, that's all.

474
30:18.769 --> 30:21.489
Pam�la is gone forever. Forget her.

475
30:21.694 --> 30:24.528
You have a good woman now, Emillie,
she takes good care of your kids.

476
30:24.619 --> 30:26.974
Yes, she's a good woman,
but Pam�la was a princess.

477
30:33.943 --> 30:35.172
No empeores las cosas.

478
30:38.513 --> 30:39.946
�Jo, no seas gilipollas!

479
30:43.633 --> 30:45.031
Wait. there's a big one right here.

480
30:46.009 --> 30:46.839
Got it.

481
30:47.837 --> 30:49.270
I got one.

482
30:49.665 --> 30:50.734
Have you seen your father and Garris?

483
30:50.945 --> 30:52.981
They're over there, walking fast.

484
30:53.871 --> 30:56.431
-They are going home.
-Shut up! They are going home.

485
30:56.613 --> 30:58.046
I'll try to catch up.

486
30:58.076 --> 30:59.030
Can I come with you?

487
30:59.355 --> 31:01.550
You don't play a fool
like last time ok?

488
31:03.011 --> 31:04.490
-You ok?
-yes.

489
31:05.388 --> 31:07.299
How can I forget that day?

490
31:07.582 --> 31:09.698
I can still feel the sun on my skin.

491
31:09.959 --> 31:11.756
I swear I can still smell

492
31:12.336 --> 31:13.928
the perfume of those roses.

493
31:16.357 --> 31:17.346
I saw Marie.

494
31:18.916 --> 31:21.306
-When? Where?
-Around 11am.

495
31:21.476 --> 31:22.954
Outside the church.

496
31:23.122 --> 31:25.113
-She did not see me.
-How was she?

497
31:25.681 --> 31:26.590
On foot.

498
31:28.240 --> 31:31.392
That's not what I'm asking.
How was she dressed?

499
31:32.993 --> 31:35.554
For instance... The colour of her dress...

500
31:35.919 --> 31:37.796
Red. Wait, let me think...

501
31:38.296 --> 31:39.968
Actually rather green.

502
31:40.307 --> 31:44.141
Cannot remember. But she was wearing
a very pretty dress.

503
31:44.693 --> 31:45.762
She was with a soldier.

504
31:46.339 --> 31:47.328
A soldier.

505
31:48.715 --> 31:50.433
Actually...

506
31:50.544 --> 31:52.660
I'm no sure. I don't think so.

507
31:54.749 --> 31:56.740
He was walking slightly in front of her, so...

508
31:57.125 --> 31:59.162
-Hello, friends!
-Hello, friends!

509
32:01.512 --> 32:03.423
I may have some work for you.

510
32:04.439 --> 32:07.351
You know, Garris?
The old lady and her rose bushes.

511
32:07.912 --> 32:09.345
The soil in her garden needs digging.

512
32:10.105 --> 32:11.505
Why don't you do it?

513
32:12.116 --> 32:13.027
I don't know how.

514
32:14.310 --> 32:16.063
I've never been good with my hands.

515
32:16.869 --> 32:19.862
I've never worked;
I'm not gonna start now!

516
32:19.978 --> 32:21.126
Alright, we'll go.

517
32:21.806 --> 32:23.682
Yes, we'll go.
Will you join us for lunch?

518
32:23.817 --> 32:24.885
With great pleasure

519
32:29.666 --> 32:31.737
-What is that?
-A Tench.

520
32:32.410 --> 32:33.683
The pond is full of them.

521
32:37.163 --> 32:38.800
This swamp is really a beautiful place.

522
32:40.818 --> 32:42.490
I understand why you stay here.

523
32:43.195 --> 32:46.153
You'll have to explain,
cos I don't understand.

524
32:47.218 --> 32:48.207
Freedom.

525
32:49.229 --> 32:50.183
Freedom.

526
32:51.240 --> 32:52.150
Come.

527
32:52.884 --> 32:53.795
Let's eat.

528
32:54.529 --> 32:55.519
Sit down.

529
33:00.015 --> 33:00.924
Don't we wait for Riton?

530
33:02.209 --> 33:03.163
Riton...

531
33:04.037 --> 33:06.505
He must be asleep.
He celebrated May 1st

532
33:06.778 --> 33:08.178
a bit too much today, Mr. Riton.

533
33:08.423 --> 33:09.538
Help yourself.

534
33:12.811 --> 33:14.450
I'm glad to have lunch with you.

535
33:15.737 --> 33:18.125
At my place for a long time,
we've been eating separately.

536
33:19.393 --> 33:22.145
We eat alone in the kitchen,
at half hour intervals.

537
33:22.318 --> 33:24.070
Your stories are not very cheerful...

538
33:29.448 --> 33:31.403
Did you hear? What is that?

539
33:31.642 --> 33:32.994
A jumping carp.

540
33:36.394 --> 33:38.431
Riton asked me a question last night.

541
33:38.771 --> 33:40.046
My father will not speak to me because...

542
33:41.880 --> 33:46.077
I refuse to marry the daughter of a hardware
store owner, Hortense.

543
33:48.096 --> 33:49.733
She had a 300.000 francs dowry.

544
33:50.471 --> 33:51.984
And a face you did not like?

545
33:52.117 --> 33:53.232
No. That's not it.

546
33:54.493 --> 33:57.530
There are some not so pretty girls who have a heart of gold.
I just didn't want.

547
33:58.882 --> 34:02.921
What I enjoy is my freedom,
my books, my music...

548
34:04.914 --> 34:06.586
Have you ever listened to jazz?

549
34:08.387 --> 34:09.297
A bit.

550
34:10.582 --> 34:13.016
I'll bring my gramophone one day,
and play for you...

551
34:13.141 --> 34:15.416
the most beautiful jazz record
I've ever listened to.

552
34:15.518 --> 34:19.476
An American I tended to at the Marne in 1918
sends them to me from Chicago.

553
34:21.002 --> 34:21.992
You were a male nurse?

554
34:23.378 --> 34:24.891
Only thing I could do.

555
34:26.670 --> 34:27.659
We needed them.

556
34:28.498 --> 34:31.092
Let me out!
I have a fight at 8pm!

557
34:31.240 --> 34:33.675
Get me out!
I want a talker to get me out!

558
34:34.713 --> 34:37.103
It's my right! Get me a talker!

559
34:37.639 --> 34:38.708
What is that?

560
34:38.735 --> 34:41.886
An attorney! If you don't know,
learn to read. I must get out!

561
34:42.210 --> 34:44.326
I must be in the ring tonight.

562
34:44.403 --> 34:45.756
Calm down, Sordi. Tomorrow you'll get an attorney.

563
34:45.865 --> 34:48.938
-Tonight you stay here...
-I do not want to stay here!

564
34:49.157 --> 34:52.307
Get me out of here right away!

565
34:53.909 --> 34:57.585
I'll get him. I'll get that bastard.

566
34:57.748 --> 34:59.148
He will pay for this!

567
35:00.126 --> 35:01.161
Very dearly!

568
35:08.534 --> 35:10.286
A car tyre. Nonsense.

569
35:10.728 --> 35:12.081
Journalists always exaggerate...

570
35:13.106 --> 35:15.414
That's too much, dad.
That's the third one.

571
35:15.664 --> 35:17.576
The doctor said you must be careful.

572
35:17.675 --> 35:19.313
What the doctor says

573
35:19.503 --> 35:22.302
is as important to me as the first
frog I ever ate raw.

574
35:22.429 --> 35:25.148
Did you really eat a frog raw?

575
35:25.353 --> 35:28.266
Yes, like that.

576
35:28.644 --> 35:31.681
-It was on a dare
-It that why you are called p�p� the frog?

577
35:32.119 --> 35:33.074
Pierrot, would you like a slap?.

578
35:33.215 --> 35:37.050
As long as I'm alive, you can keep your
slaps to yourself.

579
35:37.420 --> 35:39.057
Such arrogance!

580
35:39.797 --> 35:41.628
Marthe, we must fire the fritz.

581
35:41.807 --> 35:43.844
As long as I'm alive, forget about it.

582
35:44.367 --> 35:47.643
Firsly, Berthe is not a fritz,
she's from Alsace.

583
35:49.121 --> 35:50.030
When your poor mother passed away,

584
35:51.496 --> 35:53.293
when you were 5, Marthe,

585
35:53.873 --> 35:55.387
Berthe raised you.

586
35:57.164 --> 35:58.153
She's part of the family.

587
36:01.552 --> 36:03.224
What is this tyre story?

588
36:04.842 --> 36:06.594
Front page. Read for yourself.

589
36:07.402 --> 36:09.472
Laurent! How dare you?

590
36:09.778 --> 36:12.213
One day I'll read well and I'll teach you.

591
36:16.360 --> 36:17.634
So, this tyre?

592
36:19.650 --> 36:22.039
There was a boxing match last night at the gymnasium.

593
36:22.210 --> 36:24.849
the champion did not turn up
and the crowd ransacked the place.

594
36:24.952 --> 36:28.309
they would even have thrown an old car tyre on the ring.
According to the journalists, that is.

595
36:28.608 --> 36:29.563
Boxing does not interest me..

596
36:29.889 --> 36:33.643
since the 12 July 1921 to be exact.

597
36:34.458 --> 36:36.893
The day of the fight between
Georges Carpentier

598
36:37.018 --> 36:39.054
and Jack Dempsey,
at Jersey City.

599
36:39.213 --> 36:40.646
Dad, you're repeating yourself.

600
36:40.858 --> 36:42.610
Carpentier lost, you told us
a 100 times,

601
36:42.686 --> 36:44.483
It was a national tragedy.

602
36:44.880 --> 36:47.916
I'm not the one who said,
it was a journalist.

603
36:49.085 --> 36:51.679
Which goes to show they don't always
print nonsense.

604
36:55.666 --> 36:57.463
Won't you attend the directors' meeting?

605
36:57.494 --> 36:58.722
It's in half an hour.

606
36:59.139 --> 37:02.132
Whatever for?
You do very well wothout me.

607
37:05.721 --> 37:08.188
Pierrot, get ready for school,
the driver will be here in 5 minutes.

608
37:14.313 --> 37:15.746
Catherine, you did not touch your plate.

609
37:17.420 --> 37:18.570
I'm not hungry.

610
37:24.003 --> 37:25.072
Laurent.

611
37:26.561 --> 37:28.871
I will not change my decision.

612
37:29.853 --> 37:33.481
I am very fond of Lucien, but we cannot
announce our daughter's engagement...

613
37:33.692 --> 37:34.965
to a mere employee.

614
37:35.155 --> 37:38.431
In the fall, when Bouthillier retires,
I will make him head of Human Resources.

615
37:38.445 --> 37:39.434
Things will be different then.

616
37:39.724 --> 37:41.204
Sack Bouthillier now, then.

617
37:41.735 --> 37:45.092
And your senile father will let me do this
without protesting?

618
37:45.210 --> 37:47.041
He would rather fire me instead.

619
37:54.715 --> 37:55.704
Good Morning, Mr Richard.

620
37:56.726 --> 37:59.036
Good morning, Jules.
How is your wife?

621
37:59.103 --> 38:00.617
Slowly getting better.

622
38:00.748 --> 38:01.784
Thank you, Mr Richard.

623
38:02.393 --> 38:05.032
-Soon finished?
-By next thursday,

624
38:05.318 --> 38:06.637
we can sail away.

625
38:06.782 --> 38:08.101
In the park pond?

626
38:08.244 --> 38:09.472
It's forbidden.

627
38:09.706 --> 38:13.222
I know a place where nothing is forbidden.

628
38:15.556 --> 38:16.672
Pierrot, let's go.

629
38:19.762 --> 38:21.559
You're coming to fetch me, right?

630
38:21.773 --> 38:22.807
You bet!

631
38:39.141 --> 38:41.574
Move over, Riton.
Work faster.

632
38:41.699 --> 38:44.009
We're not cattle.
Otherwise we'd chase flies away with our tails

633
38:44.807 --> 38:46.639
Watch your mouth please.

634
38:47.367 --> 38:49.277
I'm real glad that your friends are here.

635
38:50.291 --> 38:51.246
What is your first name again?

636
38:51.938 --> 38:52.927
Am�d�e.

637
38:53.217 --> 38:55.047
I have a big stock of wool,

638
38:55.411 --> 38:57.844
I'll make you a monogrammed cardigan

639
39:03.637 --> 39:05.389
My little vice...

640
39:06.197 --> 39:08.152
oh sorry, maybe you like
to sniff tobacco too,

641
39:08.391 --> 39:09.300
Mr. Am�d�e.

642
39:31.242 --> 39:32.277
The coalman!

643
39:42.030 --> 39:45.306
Great luck,
right at my doorstep.

644
39:45.503 --> 39:46.936
Perfect for my roses.

645
39:47.148 --> 39:48.297
Leave it, I'll do it.

646
39:48.610 --> 39:49.963
Do not dirty yourself.

647
39:56.106 --> 39:58.621
-Slowing down?
-You have your hat.

648
39:58.849 --> 40:00.407
Without my cap I'm worth nothing.

649
40:00.677 --> 40:02.268
Put it here.

650
40:03.235 --> 40:04.351
And we're thirsty!

651
40:04.516 --> 40:07.474
Good God, silly me.
Did not think of that.

652
40:07.989 --> 40:09.661
You must always get noticed.

653
40:09.818 --> 40:11.773
A man needs his wine.

654
40:11.829 --> 40:13.547
Not nice to ask for it, though.

655
40:13.657 --> 40:14.806
Not nice!

656
40:15.119 --> 40:17.793
Of course, while you chit-chat on a bench,

657
40:17.862 --> 40:19.260
you don't work up much of a sweat!

658
40:19.690 --> 40:22.204
Anyway, I'm going back to the bar
to look for my cap.

659
40:22.431 --> 40:24.581
You set one foot inside that bar
and we're through.

660
40:25.722 --> 40:27.474
Don't you think you've been plenty stupid?

661
40:32.853 --> 40:34.172
Still, I don't have my cap.

662
40:36.875 --> 40:37.784
Thank you.

663
40:39.251 --> 40:40.478
Any problem?

664
40:40.896 --> 40:43.456
It's nothing.
Riton is lost his cap ...

665
40:43.639 --> 40:45.594
yesterday morning,
he's quite upset about it.

666
40:45.833 --> 40:48.552
A cap?
I have plenty of caps!

667
40:50.038 --> 40:51.311
Aren't you thirsty?

668
40:52.231 --> 40:53.949
There's a tab at the corner
of the house.

669
40:55.887 --> 40:58.606
Sometimes you're really nasty towards me.

670
40:58.996 --> 41:00.224
Real nasty.

671
41:01.007 --> 41:02.235
Mr. Riton!

672
41:02.652 --> 41:04.768
Yes, here I am!

673
41:05.393 --> 41:07.463
Here, pick one

674
41:07.771 --> 41:08.760
They were my husband's

675
41:14.717 --> 41:15.672
Looks lovely on you.

676
41:15.998 --> 41:17.032
You look like an englishman.

677
41:17.643 --> 41:19.793
Yeah, and I look like a pink flamingo.

678
41:20.019 --> 41:22.170
But you do look like a flamingo.

679
41:24.956 --> 41:26.025
Hello Mr. Richard.

680
41:26.784 --> 41:27.739
Good morning, madam.

681
41:32.817 --> 41:35.695
My neighbour.
A very rich man.

682
41:36.106 --> 41:37.664
Normal, his name is Rich-ard.

683
41:40.677 --> 41:42.713
He must be surprised to see
visitors here.

684
41:42.871 --> 41:45.704
Apart from the postman who brings my pension,
no one ever comes.

685
41:46.893 --> 41:48.246
Pour away, Mr. Riton.

686
41:51.829 --> 41:54.628
What about courtesy?
Pour for other people first...

687
41:56.034 --> 41:57.262
Sorry, Madam Mercier.

688
41:57.679 --> 41:59.193
No need to shame me in front of everybody...

689
41:59.324 --> 42:00.838
Not for me, no.

690
42:02.615 --> 42:05.891
Just a drop for me.
To drink along.

691
42:06.454 --> 42:08.650
Sorry, Riton,
Did not mean to offend.

692
42:16.693 --> 42:17.807
Goodness me!

693
42:18.155 --> 42:19.349
Pomerol?

694
42:20.166 --> 42:22.043
-It's too much, Madam Mercier.
-It's ok.

695
42:22.360 --> 42:26.148
Imagine. Just before his death,
my husband just ordered

696
42:26.199 --> 42:27.233
120 bottles.

697
42:27.478 --> 42:28.389
120 bottles!!

698
42:28.576 --> 42:29.769
And since I don't drink...

699
42:38.996 --> 42:42.068
Drink slowly, Riton.
A good wine must be savoured.

700
42:42.103 --> 42:44.059
If it was not that good,
I would not drink it so fast.

701
42:45.943 --> 42:49.492
To your husband, who was a good man
and makes us all happy.

702
42:52.342 --> 42:53.570
It's really good.

703
42:53.804 --> 42:55.318
That's not frog juice, that's for sure.

704
42:55.815 --> 42:58.250
Frog juice?
What does that mean?

705
42:59.655 --> 43:02.567
A popular expression to talk
about table wine.

706
43:03.860 --> 43:04.849
Nice metaphor

707
43:05.322 --> 43:08.472
Let me get you another bottle
to bring back.

708
43:10.074 --> 43:11.030
Riton!

709
43:13.182 --> 43:14.775
What did I do this time?

710
43:15.010 --> 43:18.286
Nothing yet, you were about to.
Leave this bottle, she did not give it to you.

711
43:19.032 --> 43:20.943
There, take this one back.

712
43:21.226 --> 43:23.980
And take the rest of the other one too.

713
43:24.335 --> 43:25.244
See?

714
43:25.431 --> 43:28.025
-We'll have to come back to finish
-Tomorrow?

715
43:28.722 --> 43:30.519
No - tomorrow we clean the mess
from the boxing arena.

716
43:31.099 --> 43:33.248
I read about that in the newspaper.

717
43:33.659 --> 43:34.614
They even said...

718
43:34.755 --> 43:37.030
someone threw a tyre onto the ring!
-Yes

719
43:37.315 --> 43:39.385
A tyre. Imagine that.

720
43:40.422 --> 43:42.777
-Let me pay you for your afternoon.
-No, no.

721
43:42.800 --> 43:45.108
You'll pay us when we're finished.
It's our rule, Riton and I.

722
43:45.724 --> 43:46.873
Our rule?

723
43:48.467 --> 43:50.458
Are we eating tyres tonight?

724
43:50.844 --> 43:53.722
No. We cleaned up the gymnasium.

725
43:53.952 --> 43:55.179
We made 20 francs each.

726
43:55.414 --> 43:57.563
Tonight we're having ham,

727
43:57.791 --> 44:00.179
pasta, camembert and cherries.

728
44:00.715 --> 44:04.152
-What's the tyre for?
-For the kids. It was in the rubbish

729
44:04.371 --> 44:08.570
we cleaned out earlier, and Garris
wanted to bring it back.

730
44:11.684 --> 44:13.197
Place it one meter high.

731
44:14.244 --> 44:16.074
No higher or
Cri-Cri could injure herself.

732
44:19.911 --> 44:21.425
Go, Cri-Cri.

733
44:21.922 --> 44:23.833
There, now we turn.

734
44:47.699 --> 44:49.690
There's your new home, Champ.

735
44:50.259 --> 44:52.295
If you keep out of trouble
nobody will bother you.

736
44:52.635 --> 44:54.273
Your friend's name is Castor.

737
44:54.646 --> 44:56.045
-A regular.
-Hello.

738
44:56.474 --> 44:58.351
Alright, have a nice stay.

739
45:06.896 --> 45:08.375
If you prefer the top bunk,

740
45:08.541 --> 45:09.530
I don't mind.

741
45:10.003 --> 45:11.675
As long as you don't wet your bed,
it'll be fine.

742
45:12.380 --> 45:14.496
I've never seen you box,
but I know about you, champ.

743
45:16.585 --> 45:18.780
I'm no more champion,
My title was stolen.

744
45:19.510 --> 45:21.387
I'm no more a boxer,
they've taken away my license.

745
45:22.434 --> 45:23.583
So shut up.

746
45:25.360 --> 45:27.157
Is this where you used to live, grandfather?

747
45:27.554 --> 45:29.032
Right here.

748
45:29.929 --> 45:30.965
I was born here,

749
45:31.759 --> 45:33.476
lived here almost 40 years.

750
45:34.135 --> 45:35.773
Your mother too was born here.

751
45:37.608 --> 45:39.440
And your granny, that you never knew,

752
45:40.900 --> 45:41.855
liked it here just fine.

753
45:41.996 --> 45:44.829
Was my granny nice to you?

754
45:46.018 --> 45:46.927
Yes.

755
45:47.847 --> 45:49.724
Come on.
Let's try out our boat.

756
45:50.954 --> 45:53.422
-They still live here?
-I think so.

757
45:55.159 --> 45:56.068
Hello little girl.

758
45:56.621 --> 45:58.101
I'm not 'little girl', my name is Cri-Cri

759
46:00.277 --> 46:02.427
You're very handsome.
Are you from the city?

760
46:02.838 --> 46:03.873
Yes, with my grandfather.

761
46:04.117 --> 46:05.789
Your boat is very pretty.

762
46:05.945 --> 46:06.900
My grandfather made it.

763
46:07.041 --> 46:08.315
Want to play with my brothers?

764
46:08.505 --> 46:11.302
Go but don't get too dirty.
Your mother would kill me.

765
46:16.182 --> 46:17.137
What's your name?

766
46:17.463 --> 46:18.418
Pierrot.

767
46:19.108 --> 46:21.338
-Like me!
-I'm Jojo. Shall we play with your boat?

768
46:21.485 --> 46:23.998
Keep quiet!
Shall we play with your boat?

769
46:24.226 --> 46:25.739
-I'd like to.
-Come.

770
46:29.346 --> 46:30.300
Good day.

771
46:31.905 --> 46:32.815
Good day.

772
46:34.648 --> 46:35.557
Please have a seat.

773
46:40.864 --> 46:42.820
An old man used to live here.

774
46:44.336 --> 46:46.532
He's dead. I'm living here now.

775
46:47.811 --> 46:51.849
I used to live here too, with my wife and daughter.
A bit further up.

776
46:53.295 --> 46:55.012
Collecting scrap iron.

777
46:55.489 --> 46:58.878
I had a donkey to pull my cart: Bourricot.

778
47:00.242 --> 47:02.436
He was more intelligent than many people I've known.

779
47:03.898 --> 47:06.014
We did quite some traveling together.

780
47:06.824 --> 47:07.858
I still have his blanket

781
47:08.286 --> 47:09.684
with smell of my good companion on it.

782
47:14.501 --> 47:17.175
All these potatoes for you alone?
That's a lot.

783
47:17.427 --> 47:20.577
The kids next door love saut�ed potatoes.
There's never enough.

784
47:21.266 --> 47:22.300
Would you like a glass of wine?

785
47:25.105 --> 47:27.938
I did not dare ask, but I won't say no.

786
47:36.623 --> 47:37.817
Your boat goes well.

787
47:50.333 --> 47:51.289
And after that?

788
47:52.161 --> 47:53.072
After that?

789
47:54.172 --> 47:55.400
After that...

790
47:57.280 --> 48:01.114
After that, I started scrapping iron for myself instead of others.

791
48:02.217 --> 48:06.255
My warehouse became a factory, I had
electricity installed, the works...

792
48:06.788 --> 48:09.746
To tell you how it happened is not interesting.

793
48:09.894 --> 48:12.967
All I know is that I became an imbecile.

794
48:14.465 --> 48:17.856
From the swamp to owner of the Richard foundries,

795
48:18.670 --> 48:20.023
I don't think you're an imbecile.

796
48:20.498 --> 48:23.536
The old man told me. When I moved to town with my family...

797
48:26.349 --> 48:27.577
You're not happy here?

798
48:28.907 --> 48:31.137
You think the swamp cannot make you a living,

799
48:31.284 --> 48:32.684
you and your family?

800
48:33.112 --> 48:34.431
You will live to regret it.

801
48:34.759 --> 48:38.114
Even if you make millions, you will regret it.

802
48:39.146 --> 48:41.614
You know what you are, p�p� the frog? An imbecile.

803
48:44.996 --> 48:45.951
Would you like one?

804
48:46.458 --> 48:48.050
I don't mind if I do.

805
48:49.018 --> 48:51.532
These days I have to hide to smoke

806
48:55.599 --> 48:57.237
Why did they call you p�p� the frog?

807
48:59.438 --> 49:01.235
I'm called that way because

808
49:01.449 --> 49:04.601
I'm supposed to have eaten a live frog, on a dare.

809
49:05.289 --> 49:06.403
But it's not true.

810
49:07.300 --> 49:08.858
The old man called me p�p� the frog

811
49:09.494 --> 49:11.961
Cos I was good at catching frogs.

812
49:14.612 --> 49:16.092
The old man was right.

813
49:16.623 --> 49:18.420
I should never have left the swamp.

814
49:20.646 --> 49:21.998
I feel good here.

815
49:23.387 --> 49:24.786
Could I come back visit you?

816
49:26.130 --> 49:27.119
Whenever you want.

817
49:30.882 --> 49:31.793
Pierrot!

818
49:31.980 --> 49:33.617
My boy, I told you not to  dirty yourself!

819
49:36.367 --> 49:37.721
My daughter Marthe must not know

820
49:37.829 --> 49:39.422
that we came here.

821
49:40.023 --> 49:41.092
We were supposed to be in the park!

822
49:41.304 --> 49:43.021
In the park. I swear.

823
49:43.315 --> 49:44.907
Me too. I swear.

824
49:45.692 --> 49:46.726
Don't worry, we'll clean him up

825
49:46.788 --> 49:48.016
in the basin. Come

826
49:48.798 --> 49:50.152
Thank you, sir. Go.

827
49:57.940 --> 50:00.090
Take off your clothes and get in here.

828
50:05.800 --> 50:07.836
Please, it disturbs me if you look.

829
50:09.458 --> 50:12.927
I know. Few people these days believe
in love at first sight.

830
50:14.393 --> 50:16.224
But this was the day I got struck.

831
50:17.501 --> 50:18.934
Look at you!

832
50:19.695 --> 50:22.369
I ask you for the last time
Were did you go?

833
50:23.168 --> 50:24.887
-In the park.
-Do you want a slap?

834
50:24.996 --> 50:27.465
This is becoming a habit!
I brought him to the swamp.

835
50:27.922 --> 50:29.719
What? In that place?

836
50:29.932 --> 50:31.251
Yes, where you were born, Marthe.

837
50:32.309 --> 50:33.902
I don't want to hear about it.

838
50:34.137 --> 50:35.490
Laurent does not want people to know about it.

839
50:35.965 --> 50:39.514
Go and change into your pajamas.
Everything you're wearing goes to the wash.

840
50:39.623 --> 50:41.021
No lice in this house!

841
50:41.998 --> 50:44.114
You never had any lice when you lived there, Marthe.

842
50:46.204 --> 50:47.956
Grandfather, I did not betray you.

843
50:48.215 --> 50:49.170
No.

844
50:51.871 --> 50:53.907
-Good evening, Berthe.
-Good evening.

845
50:54.065 --> 50:56.021
Dad, you can go to your swamp
whenever you want,...

846
50:56.076 --> 50:57.509
but not with my son.

847
51:01.561 --> 51:04.199
What would you like to eat this evening?

848
51:04.851 --> 51:07.364
-Saut�ed potatoes.
-Consider it done.

849
51:13.992 --> 51:15.311
Have you heard, Champ?

850
51:15.820 --> 51:18.050
The president got shot.

851
51:18.744 --> 51:20.177
Why do I care?

852
51:20.391 --> 51:22.699
They also mention you in the newspaper.

853
51:23.132 --> 51:24.646
Never killed anyone myself.

854
51:25.327 --> 51:27.318
You're gonna get clobbered in civil court

855
51:27.521 --> 51:31.400
About 10 of them filing against you,
asking for damages.

856
51:32.273 --> 51:35.630
The bar owner, 2 clients, 3 police officers.

857
51:36.478 --> 51:38.867
The fight promoter, your manager

858
51:39.768 --> 51:42.681
and the owner of the arena that was ransacked.

859
51:42.876 --> 51:44.025
It's all in the newspaper?

860
51:44.157 --> 51:45.146
Word for word.

861
51:45.436 --> 51:47.472
Eh, Jo. Want to read it?

862
51:47.996 --> 51:51.306
I have a talker who takes care
of all this nonsense.

863
51:52.384 --> 51:53.862
118 bottles!

864
51:54.394 --> 51:58.023
Please, Marie mother of God, let me
drink just one bottle

865
51:58.233 --> 51:59.586
before being hit by lightning.

866
52:03.353 --> 52:04.626
Come, gentlemen.

867
52:04.998 --> 52:06.590
Come inside for shelter.

868
52:14.322 --> 52:15.550
Why didn't you come and play with me?

869
52:15.967 --> 52:18.527
Mister guard did not let me in.

870
52:18.708 --> 52:19.902
Will you come next thursday?

871
52:21.085 --> 52:23.804
-You want my ball?
-I'd like to, but what if you get scolded?

872
52:24.193 --> 52:25.751
I'll say I lost it.

873
52:27.849 --> 52:29.077
Pierrot!

874
52:30.043 --> 52:31.318
Where are you?

875
52:31.871 --> 52:35.262
Come over here right this minute.
You're gonna catch a deadly cold!

876
52:36.077 --> 52:37.351
See you thursday?

877
52:37.356 --> 52:38.266
See you thursday.

878
52:38.635 --> 52:42.264
If you have followed my story,
one thing is sure:

879
52:43.023 --> 52:46.460
the stupidity of adults meant that Pierrot and I
could not see each other any more.

880
52:49.056 --> 52:51.286
No frog juice, eh, Mr Riton?

881
52:51.981 --> 52:53.050
You said it!

882
52:53.445 --> 52:54.923
You know what, Madam Mercier?

883
52:55.090 --> 52:57.045
Something good about such heavy rain

884
52:57.284 --> 52:59.161
If the sun comes out straight afterwards

885
52:59.478 --> 53:00.797
it's a good time for snails.

886
53:01.123 --> 53:03.876
It's exactly what I was thinking about.

887
53:04.047 --> 53:06.925
We could take the Tane train
and go towards the black forest.

888
53:06.972 --> 53:09.088
Great minds think alike.

889
53:11.726 --> 53:14.193
I am not expecting anyone!

890
53:15.016 --> 53:16.574
Here comes the other great spirit.

891
53:17.210 --> 53:19.644
Mr. Am�d�e, you are soaking wet.

892
53:20.318 --> 53:22.594
Sorry for barging in unannounced.

893
53:23.061 --> 53:24.813
I'll take off my shoes to avoid dirtying your floors.

894
53:26.534 --> 53:27.762
Did you notice?

895
53:28.179 --> 53:29.090
What?

896
53:29.460 --> 53:30.494
The portrait looks like your Marie.

897
53:31.471 --> 53:34.463
My Marie? I only saw her once.

898
53:34.760 --> 53:36.114
Come in, Mr. Am�d�e.

899
53:36.224 --> 53:37.373
Your friends are here.

900
53:37.869 --> 53:39.097
Give me your jacquet.

901
53:39.331 --> 53:41.128
I'll hang it in the kitchen to dry.

902
53:41.525 --> 53:43.039
I went to see my notary public

903
53:43.536 --> 53:47.211
Got caught in the rain on the way back.
Almost fell off my bike.

904
53:48.289 --> 53:49.847
Yo usee your notary often these days, no?

905
53:49.934 --> 53:52.244
It's for a plot of land I wish to sell on the Graves road.

906
53:52.860 --> 53:54.532
He may have found me a buyer.

907
53:55.601 --> 53:57.478
-Congrats, you're gonna be rich.
-Rich, no.

908
53:57.612 --> 54:00.411
But I may be able to redecorate my room

909
54:01.086 --> 54:02.599
or buy some books.

910
54:02.914 --> 54:04.746
I made you some coffee.

911
54:07.119 --> 54:08.074
Do you like this protrait, Mr. Garris?

912
54:10.045 --> 54:11.193
Reminds him of someone.

913
54:12.056 --> 54:15.128
Reason enough to take it.
I've gathered too many things

914
54:15.530 --> 54:17.248
I'm glad to get rid of some.

915
54:17.722 --> 54:19.519
-Listen, Madam Mercier...
-Do take it

916
54:19.552 --> 54:21.269
It has no value anyway.

917
54:21.380 --> 54:24.690
I got it from the provision shop, in exchange of some coupons.

918
54:24.853 --> 54:25.762
Take it.

919
54:26.864 --> 54:29.458
I can't tell you how happy I am
to have some company.

920
54:29.972 --> 54:32.804
Without you, in such bad weather,

921
54:34.177 --> 54:35.405
I would be sad the entire afternoon.

922
54:37.467 --> 54:38.456
Mr. Pignole!

923
54:39.478 --> 54:40.628
No smoking in front of a lady.

924
54:40.757 --> 54:41.907
At least ask for permission.

925
54:42.403 --> 54:44.519
You don't mind if I smoke, Madam Mercier?

926
54:44.780 --> 54:46.690
Of course not, Mr. Riton.

927
54:47.157 --> 54:49.751
Actually, I'll have a quick sniff myself...

928
54:50.630 --> 54:51.744
Mr. Am�d�e?

929
54:52.275 --> 54:53.391
Not keen.

930
54:54.835 --> 54:57.302
See Garris, you can smoke too.
You just have to ask for permission.

931
55:02.148 --> 55:03.581
This is good weather.

932
55:06.536 --> 55:07.889
It's written in my book:

933
55:08.364 --> 55:10.400
"water in the gutters, time for snails"

934
55:10.922 --> 55:13.231
Don't you invent some of your sayings?

935
55:13.847 --> 55:16.840
My book also says: "strangers irritate you,
friends break your heart."

936
55:17.322 --> 55:21.155
You're right for once. Tomorrow we pick snails.
Money to be made.

937
55:21.527 --> 55:23.403
We leave very early.
So tonight,

938
55:24.268 --> 55:25.588
you don't drink, you sleep.

939
55:27.010 --> 55:27.965
Are you coming along, Am�d�e?

940
55:28.474 --> 55:29.702
A nice walk, you'll get a tan.

941
55:29.936 --> 55:32.403
I'd love to. I've never been to pick snails.

942
55:32.860 --> 55:36.570
We meet at 6am, the train station near the market.

943
55:36.699 --> 55:37.655
Agreed?

944
55:37.980 --> 55:39.572
-Agreed

945
55:49.315 --> 55:52.148
Don't go so fast. The Tane train won't leave without us.

946
55:54.615 --> 55:56.846
-I have delicate feet!
-Come on!

947
55:58.273 --> 56:00.025
Hi guys, how are you?

948
56:00.648 --> 56:04.119
After the Vacherie stop,
you jump off halfway up the slope, ok?

949
56:04.306 --> 56:06.137
You'll see, there's a congress
of big Bourgogne snails.

950
56:06.864 --> 56:09.538
-You're the best, Tane.
-Only a train driver...

951
56:09.606 --> 56:10.722
Let's go.

952
56:18.016 --> 56:19.449
My feet!

953
56:19.844 --> 56:21.914
Come on, sit down.

954
56:25.878 --> 56:26.947
Where's Am�d�e?

955
56:32.094 --> 56:33.003
Wait for me!

956
56:34.288 --> 56:36.164
Come on Am�d�e!

957
56:36.298 --> 56:37.208
Quick!

958
56:37.577 --> 56:39.250
Use the steps, here.

959
56:41.418 --> 56:44.693
Sorry. I took too long to bathe this morning.

960
56:45.257 --> 56:46.690
No here.

961
56:47.268 --> 56:48.302
It's fragile.

962
56:49.461 --> 56:50.416
Sit down.

963
56:56.590 --> 56:59.583
The way you're dressed, the snails
will hide in their shells.

964
57:00.795 --> 57:02.911
It's my first time,
I did not know what to wear.

965
57:17.614 --> 57:20.447
I spent part of the night reading about
snails in our region.

966
57:20.722 --> 57:22.121
Would you like some good advice?

967
57:22.916 --> 57:24.065
Always useful.

968
57:24.561 --> 57:25.550
We must stop halfway up the slope,

969
57:25.659 --> 57:28.650
after the place called 'La Vacherie'.

970
57:29.132 --> 57:30.963
In May-June, after strong rains,

971
57:30.960 --> 57:33.713
big Bourgognes are everywhere,
falling over each other.

972
57:35.349 --> 57:37.067
You're the best, Am�d�e.

973
57:39.735 --> 57:41.487
I'm happy I came along.

974
57:56.737 --> 57:58.568
Get ready, it's about time.

975
58:05.148 --> 58:06.057
Come on, Am�d�e!

976
58:16.481 --> 58:17.994
I'm really happy I came along.

977
58:19.773 --> 58:20.728
What an adventure!

978
58:32.387 --> 58:33.900
I'm going back to my slippers.

979
58:35.860 --> 58:38.375
Can someone help?
My two hands are full.

980
58:38.786 --> 58:40.663
Leave them here.
You'll pick them up on your way back.

981
58:40.980 --> 58:42.173
Ok.

982
59:06.208 --> 59:07.119
Let's go.

983
59:07.306 --> 59:09.820
Garris! Lots of small grey ones over here.

984
59:10.047 --> 59:11.447
No, don't take the grey ones.

985
59:12.059 --> 59:14.447
Only bourgognes.
They sell better.

986
59:14.983 --> 59:15.972
Ok - I let you go.

987
59:16.994 --> 59:18.143
You're lucky.

988
59:19.005 --> 59:20.485
No small grey ones, he said.

989
59:25.222 --> 59:26.210
Good hunt?

990
59:32.168 --> 59:34.045
Forgive me for not helping,
I hate slugs.

991
59:34.179 --> 59:36.409
They are not slugs.

992
59:40.577 --> 59:43.297
Garris! Time for lunch.

993
59:44.965 --> 59:45.920
An onion

994
59:46.063 --> 59:47.815
Leave me something to drink this time.

995
59:48.438 --> 59:49.507
You see how he treats me?

996
59:49.902 --> 59:52.416
He likes you very much.
He teases you because he's shy.

997
59:52.643 --> 59:55.681
I know, I'm not that dumb.

998
59:57.579 --> 59:58.648
But sometimes,

999
59:59.407 --> 01:00:02.001
I fear he'll do what he's been meaning to do
for quite sometime.

1000
01:00:02.882 --> 01:00:03.791
Which is?

1001
01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:05.882
Going back on the road.

1002
01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:09.094
Leave.

1003
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:13.264
Because he can make do on his own, anywhere.

1004
01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:16.447
I know that he stayed because of me and the children.

1005
01:00:19.152 --> 01:00:20.380
Us, without him...

1006
01:00:22.992 --> 01:00:25.552
Is this a funeral?
What's the matter?

1007
01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:28.947
-Noting. I was talking about Pam�la.
-Ah, ok.

1008
01:00:31.219 --> 01:00:33.016
May I read you a few lines?

1009
01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:36.146
I think they were written for us.

1010
01:00:36.519 --> 01:00:38.317
-Certainly.
-If it's not too long.

1011
01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:39.885
Of course not!

1012
01:00:40.358 --> 01:00:41.268
Listen.

1013
01:00:42.188 --> 01:00:45.862
"Liberty is not lazyness, it's free use of one's time,

1014
01:00:46.027 --> 01:00:47.778
it's the choice of the work and the exercise.

1015
01:00:48.038 --> 01:00:50.313
Being free, in short, is not doing nothing,

1016
01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:53.451
but being the sole decider of what to do
or what not to do.

1017
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.778
You understand?

1018
01:00:59.371 --> 01:01:02.170
I understand that being free,

1019
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.389
it's like the way we live.

1020
01:01:03.943 --> 01:01:04.898
Precisely!

1021
01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.001
We are the last free men!

1022
01:01:14.362 --> 01:01:15.637
I'm really glad I came along.

1023
01:01:17.289 --> 01:01:18.563
What an adventure!

1024
01:01:28.257 --> 01:01:30.010
Come on, hurry up.

1025
01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:36.384
Riton really has no luck.

1026
01:01:37.032 --> 01:01:39.182
There's only one idiot in the whole world

1027
01:01:39.409 --> 01:01:41.969
capable of leaving his shoes on the train rails.

1028
01:01:42.152 --> 01:01:43.664
I don't care about the shoes.

1029
01:01:43.797 --> 01:01:45.753
This way they won't hurt my feet anymore.

1030
01:01:46.722 --> 01:01:47.632
Are you happy now?

1031
01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:49.320
Hop on board.

1032
01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:09.918
This poor bird threw itself at the train right
at the entrance of the village of Voux.

1033
01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:12.431
Here, for your kids, Riton.

1034
01:02:13.047 --> 01:02:14.561
You're not dropping off for a drink?

1035
01:02:15.059 --> 01:02:16.333
I'm not allowed to.

1036
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:17.431
He can't go to the bar bare feet.

1037
01:02:17.617 --> 01:02:19.016
He'd look like a vagrant.

1038
01:02:19.628 --> 01:02:20.617
He would shame us.

1039
01:02:20.726 --> 01:02:22.920
You're right. And his feet are not very clean.

1040
01:02:23.103 --> 01:02:25.014
And your face, fatso, you think it's clean?

1041
01:02:25.478 --> 01:02:26.831
Come along, Am�d�e.

1042
01:02:34.436 --> 01:02:35.916
You didn't think I'd forget about you?

1043
01:02:40.105 --> 01:02:41.014
Smile first.

1044
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:45.900
I need a lot of patience with you.

1045
01:02:46.503 --> 01:02:50.382
'Patience and white wine win over
strength or rage".

1046
01:02:50.525 --> 01:02:52.719
I never got to taste Tane's turkey.

1047
01:02:53.998 --> 01:02:55.909
It was early June, I think.

1048
01:02:56.923 --> 01:02:59.677
I mostly remember the smell of compresses.

1049
01:03:01.128 --> 01:03:02.039
Painful?

1050
01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:08.476
That's what you get for playing in the rain.

1051
01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:10.867
Her dress is ruined.

1052
01:03:11.001 --> 01:03:13.275
I'll buy her a nice new one
with the money from the snails.

1053
01:03:13.559 --> 01:03:15.311
My hat first.

1054
01:03:15.753 --> 01:03:17.346
I've been asking you for months.

1055
01:03:17.947 --> 01:03:19.858
What do I look like, going to town
without a hat.

1056
01:03:21.237 --> 01:03:22.829
I'll buy you the dress.

1057
01:03:27.088 --> 01:03:29.603
You sick my daughter is real sick?

1058
01:03:30.378 --> 01:03:32.768
She caught a cold,
she's not very strong.

1059
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.820
Luckily it's the warm season.
The sun makes everything better.

1060
01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:57.376
-Snails, ladies and gentlemen?
-Your bourgognes are big.

1061
01:03:57.619 --> 01:03:59.813
Picked yesterday,
soaked last night and cleaned this morning.

1062
01:03:59.996 --> 01:04:02.954
-1 Franc per dozen.
-Go ahead, we don't do this every day.

1063
01:04:03.286 --> 01:04:04.958
-4 Dozens please.
-Off we go.

1064
01:04:09.501 --> 01:04:10.411
4 Dozens for me too.

1065
01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:13.012
Straight away madam.
There's enough to go around.

1066
01:04:13.159 --> 01:04:14.273
Hello, Mister accordeon player.

1067
01:04:16.632 --> 01:04:17.586
Hello, Marie.

1068
01:04:18.094 --> 01:04:19.369
You sell snails these days?

1069
01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:23.177
I sell a bit of everything, depends on the weather.
You want some?

1070
01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.614
They're not on my mistress's shopping list.

1071
01:04:27.601 --> 01:04:28.635
And my 4 dozens?

1072
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.599
Certainly madam. They're not gonna fly off.

1073
01:04:34.547 --> 01:04:36.219
I waited for you, you know.

1074
01:04:36.559 --> 01:04:37.833
Is that so? Why?

1075
01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:39.684
You were supposed to come and visit.

1076
01:04:40.947 --> 01:04:44.826
I don't have much free time.
But I'll  come, you can count on it.

1077
01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:48.115
Do you like earrings?

1078
01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:50.266
Yes.

1079
01:04:53.195 --> 01:04:54.150
Riton!

1080
01:04:56.302 --> 01:04:58.054
Yes! Good day.

1081
01:05:00.143 --> 01:05:02.373
There you go, madam.
Thank you very much.

1082
01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:06.034
Take my place. 1 franc 50 per dozen.

1083
01:05:06.907 --> 01:05:07.862
Hello, Marie.

1084
01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:08.958
Hello

1085
01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:12.498
How much for a dozen?

1086
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.056
2 Francs. It's cheap if you consider the trouble I went through.

1087
01:05:15.681 --> 01:05:17.081
-One dozen then.

1088
01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:24.170
-I think the blue ones suit you best.
-You think so?

1089
01:05:24.456 --> 01:05:27.130
The gentleman is right. they are the ones, no hesitation.

1090
01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:28.108
Ok, the blue ones, then.

1091
01:05:30.672 --> 01:05:31.628
Good Bye, lovers.

1092
01:05:35.425 --> 01:05:36.824
Why did you buy me a gift?

1093
01:05:37.619 --> 01:05:38.655
Because it makes me happy.

1094
01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:41.929
11am! I must be going.

1095
01:05:42.556 --> 01:05:45.353
-I'll come visit. I promise.
-Soon?

1096
01:05:46.394 --> 01:05:48.670
As soon as I have enough free time.

1097
01:05:49.686 --> 01:05:51.244
-Good Bye
-Thank you

1098
01:05:52.427 --> 01:05:54.737
How are you, Don Juan?

1099
01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:56.887
I'll get back to my station.

1100
01:05:56.998 --> 01:05:58.670
To do what?

1101
01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:02.172
No more snails. Even at 2.50.

1102
01:06:11.257 --> 01:06:13.054
Doesn't mean much, you know.

1103
01:06:13.086 --> 01:06:16.159
No. It means absolutely nothing.

1104
01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:29.663
I bought it for you at the market.
You like it?

1105
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.458
It's beautiful.

1106
01:06:32.648 --> 01:06:33.717
Good quality.

1107
01:06:34.293 --> 01:06:37.204
He keeps his word.
Not like you with my hat.

1108
01:06:37.766 --> 01:06:38.835
You'll have your hat.

1109
01:06:39.411 --> 01:06:41.846
You'll sleep with it.
You'll be buried with it.

1110
01:06:44.347 --> 01:06:45.576
I'll make you another poultice.

1111
01:06:45.994 --> 01:06:47.791
I want my football.

1112
01:06:49.284 --> 01:06:50.273
Pierrot!

1113
01:06:50.746 --> 01:06:52.623
Jojo! The football, over here, straight away!

1114
01:06:53.306 --> 01:06:54.375
And hurry up!

1115
01:06:56.414 --> 01:06:58.405
Living proof that bad temper means good heart.

1116
01:06:58.608 --> 01:06:59.960
There, little Cri-Cri.

1117
01:07:06.835 --> 01:07:08.666
Sorry, am I intruding?

1118
01:07:08.846 --> 01:07:10.757
Not at all.
Come on in, Mr. Richard.

1119
01:07:11.222 --> 01:07:13.655
No Mister between us.
P�p�, like everyone calls me.

1120
01:07:13.965 --> 01:07:16.195
Or buddy, like you say around here.

1121
01:07:17.255 --> 01:07:20.246
A gift from my personal stash.

1122
01:07:21.277 --> 01:07:23.153
I know someone who's gonna be happy.

1123
01:07:26.945 --> 01:07:28.014
Did you paint this?

1124
01:07:29.686 --> 01:07:33.760
No. I just wanted to touch it up.

1125
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.349
Why?

1126
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:40.967
So that it looks more like someone I know.

1127
01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:45.378
This young lady is lovely.

1128
01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:47.599
Sit down.

1129
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.025
Your friend Riton is not here?

1130
01:07:53.635 --> 01:07:54.829
No. He's catching frogs.

1131
01:07:56.012 --> 01:07:58.811
Frogs? at the pond of the 3 priests?

1132
01:07:58.938 --> 01:08:00.735
I'm going. Give me a fishing rod and some line.

1133
01:08:00.949 --> 01:08:03.985
Take the rod outside, it's ready.
I'll give you a hook.

1134
01:08:04.056 --> 01:08:06.967
No need.

1135
01:08:07.164 --> 01:08:08.119
Really?

1136
01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:10.244
P�p�.

1137
01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:13.572
This is not for fun. We have an order from the Grand Hotel
for 20 dozens for tomorrow night.

1138
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:16.863
You don't know me, son!
You don't know p�p� the frog.

1139
01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:22.490
Here come the reinforcements.

1140
01:08:22.887 --> 01:08:24.114
I did not hear you arrive.

1141
01:08:33.672 --> 01:08:36.028
-Can I take one of your frogs?
-Help yourself.

1142
01:08:57.255 --> 01:09:00.167
You don't use a hook?

1143
01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:03.958
No need. It damages them.

1144
01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:40.496
How do you do it?

1145
01:09:40.766 --> 01:09:42.802
Not difficult, I'll teach you.

1146
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.484
Garris must see this,

1147
01:09:47.164 --> 01:09:48.961
Otherwise he won't believe me, as usual.

1148
01:09:51.918 --> 01:09:53.591
-Are you sick?
-No.

1149
01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:57.938
How come you're lying in bed when it's sunny outside?

1150
01:09:58.134 --> 01:10:00.523
-That's not like you.
-Sometimes, you need to think.

1151
01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:05.201
True. People are not used to thinking anymore.

1152
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.476
But don't do too much of it.

1153
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:09.621
Just like for wine.

1154
01:10:09.652 --> 01:10:11.529
You can meditate without help from the bottle.

1155
01:10:12.028 --> 01:10:14.587
Are you gonna keep lecturing me much longer?

1156
01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.247
Get up, I need an opinion.

1157
01:10:25.739 --> 01:10:29.015
What's that huge book,
the history of the world?

1158
01:10:29.943 --> 01:10:32.902
I wanted your input for the new
wallpaper in my bedroom.

1159
01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:36.251
You understand?
I'd like flowers in my room,

1160
01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:39.018
but not too big, not too garish.

1161
01:10:40.547 --> 01:10:42.618
Flowers that let me listen to music.

1162
01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:44.905
That's not the way to choose.

1163
01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:46.942
Look.

1164
01:10:53.162 --> 01:10:54.230
Long live anarchy!

1165
01:10:57.367 --> 01:10:58.277
That's what you need.

1166
01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:00.413
Forget me nots?

1167
01:11:02.119 --> 01:11:03.269
Forget me nots!

1168
01:11:03.399 --> 01:11:04.514
-You think so?
-Sure.

1169
01:11:06.324 --> 01:11:07.552
Forget me nots!

1170
01:11:08.702 --> 01:11:11.136
You're right!
Everything goes well with forget me nots.

1171
01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:12.958
Mozart, Bizet,

1172
01:11:13.088 --> 01:11:13.998
Haendel,

1173
01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:16.396
Louis Armstrong...

1174
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:21.262
Thanks. You have solved a great dilemma.

1175
01:11:21.498 --> 01:11:24.252
Let's not exxagerate.
I just have the knack for these things.

1176
01:11:24.423 --> 01:11:25.493
Come and look!

1177
01:11:25.703 --> 01:11:28.615
He took 120. 120!
And without a hook. Come, quickly!

1178
01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:31.863
Come Am�d�e.
We must see that.

1179
01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:51.064
I told you.

1180
01:11:56.965 --> 01:11:59.194
10 years ago, I would have done your 20 dozens.

1181
01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.719
But I'm a bit tired now.

1182
01:12:02.449 --> 01:12:05.202
-How many did you catch in the end?
-I don't know. I didn't count.

1183
01:12:08.483 --> 01:12:09.631
I don't know how to count.

1184
01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:17.265
For money, my wife used to handle all this.

1185
01:12:20.914 --> 01:12:23.871
At least, I have not lost the knack
for frog fishing.

1186
01:12:24.204 --> 01:12:25.193
Indeed!

1187
01:12:56.746 --> 01:12:59.215
Will you cut it out with your negro music!

1188
01:13:00.037 --> 01:13:01.550
Gives me headaches!

1189
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.760
Isn't it sublime?

1190
01:13:12.103 --> 01:13:13.422
-Once again?
-No,

1191
01:13:13.748 --> 01:13:16.582
Otherwise Emilie will come with her carpet beater,
and your gramophone... Boom!

1192
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:20.532
Ayway I must replace the diamond and I didn't bring a spare.
I would not want to damage this disk.

1193
01:13:20.878 --> 01:13:21.993
What did you say it was?

1194
01:13:22.157 --> 01:13:26.514
'West End Blues". The trumpet player
is Louis Armstrong, the best.

1195
01:13:28.556 --> 01:13:31.070
To p�p� the frog,

1196
01:13:31.298 --> 01:13:33.095
the ace of frog fishing.

1197
01:13:34.407 --> 01:13:35.317
To friendship.

1198
01:13:35.503 --> 01:13:37.699
To friendship,
�Eh, I got an idea!

1199
01:13:38.429 --> 01:13:39.145
I don't believe you.

1200
01:13:40.256 --> 01:13:42.487
The hook damaged my frogs.

1201
01:13:42.634 --> 01:13:46.309
They won't be good for the Grand H�tel.
Shall we eat them tonight?

1202
01:13:49.764 --> 01:13:51.560
My apologies.
This is a great idea.

1203
01:13:51.774 --> 01:13:53.413
What do you say, p�p�?

1204
01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:54.512
Well, yes.

1205
01:13:54.516 --> 01:13:56.155
Maybe you're expected back at home.

1206
01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:58.221
I don't care if I'm expected.

1207
01:13:58.355 --> 01:13:59.789
My son-in-law wil make noise - great.

1208
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:03.789
My daughter will not talk to me for 3 days.
At least I won't hear her voice.

1209
01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:05.481
You, Am�d�e?

1210
01:14:05.485 --> 01:14:08.796
Nobody ever expects me.
And I've never eaten frog legs.

1211
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:10.655
I'd like to try.

1212
01:14:10.787 --> 01:14:12.265
I'll do the cooking.

1213
01:14:12.432 --> 01:14:14.947
Ok. Riton skins the frog,
I take care of the fire,

1214
01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:17.452
-and Am�d�e sets the table.
-Alright.

1215
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:21.065
It's Cri-Cri.

1216
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.587
-She'd like to meet the rich mister.
-Keep quiet. She'd like to see the rich mister.

1217
01:14:25.047 --> 01:14:26.844
The rich mister's name is p�p�.

1218
01:14:27.057 --> 01:14:29.447
Tell Cri-Cri I finish my glass
and will be right over.

1219
01:14:29.618 --> 01:14:30.528
Let's go.

1220
01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:32.893
What's your first name?

1221
01:14:33.273 --> 01:14:35.913
I would not like to spoil the evening.
Hyacinth.

1222
01:14:38.393 --> 01:14:41.271
Calling me that is forbidden!

1223
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:43.650
And you, son, if you want to make me happy,

1224
01:14:43.877 --> 01:14:47.153
Stop being so respectful.
As if I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth!

1225
01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:49.389
I've lived in this swamp much longer than you have.

1226
01:14:50.275 --> 01:14:52.744
Sorry p�p�, but there's no shame in being rich.

1227
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.918
Especially when you earned it with your own hands.

1228
01:14:55.577 --> 01:14:57.091
I'd like to be rich.

1229
01:14:57.222 --> 01:14:59.532
I was never richer than when I lived here.

1230
01:15:04.353 --> 01:15:05.865
You wanted to talk to me, darling?

1231
01:15:06.363 --> 01:15:10.118
I could not go and join Pierrot from town in the park.

1232
01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:12.318
I had promised.

1233
01:15:13.128 --> 01:15:16.881
I will explain to him that you were sick.
Is that what you want?

1234
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:18.104
Yes.

1235
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:19.943
No wonder I found him a bit sad.

1236
01:15:20.257 --> 01:15:21.896
He was a bit sad?

1237
01:15:22.817 --> 01:15:24.216
But not too much?

1238
01:15:25.011 --> 01:15:28.719
No. But I will tell him that
you are resting well.

1239
01:15:29.398 --> 01:15:33.596
And if you rest well, next week
you can come and play with him.

1240
01:15:33.603 --> 01:15:35.434
But what if the guard won't let me in?

1241
01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:37.961
Don't worry, I'll be there.

1242
01:15:38.356 --> 01:15:40.234
Nobody will prevent you from getting in.

1243
01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:42.634
See you on thursday, my darling.

1244
01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:46.110
Good night Madam.

1245
01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:50.521
Tell Riton that if he comes back after the kids are asleep,
he can go sleep outside.

1246
01:15:50.605 --> 01:15:52.244
I will tell him, Madam.

1247
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.239
Why are you always nasty, mommy?

1248
01:15:58.832 --> 01:15:59.787
I don't know.

1249
01:16:01.756 --> 01:16:02.666
I don't know.

1250
01:16:09.253 --> 01:16:12.005
Do you know what time it is?

1251
01:16:12.177 --> 01:16:13.246
I don't care.

1252
01:16:13.823 --> 01:16:16.131
Let me see. You've been drinking!

1253
01:16:16.565 --> 01:16:18.681
Pommerol. Excellent.

1254
01:16:20.405 --> 01:16:22.600
And where were you? Tell me.

1255
01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.364
With some friends of mine.

1256
01:16:25.889 --> 01:16:27.402
-You don't have any friends
-On the contrary.

1257
01:16:27.534 --> 01:16:29.172
I have friends.

1258
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.770
And who are these friends?
People from "there", I suppose.

1259
01:16:33.932 --> 01:16:36.003
Yes. And please don't talk so loud.

1260
01:16:36.493 --> 01:16:38.449
You'll wake up everyone.

1261
01:16:40.148 --> 01:16:43.345
It's strange, this habit you have
of talking that way.

1262
01:16:50.387 --> 01:16:56.319
-No, not this horrible thing.
-There, smell it, memories!

1263
01:16:59.344 --> 01:17:02.655
Do you know what I had for dinner this evening?

1264
01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:04.641
No.

1265
01:17:04.828 --> 01:17:05.783
Frogs!

1266
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.750
Alive?

1267
01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:08.846
Alive!

1268
01:17:16.346 --> 01:17:22.386
Ah Bourricot. It's difficult to have some peace and quiet.

1269
01:17:22.563 --> 01:17:24.917
Hello, Joseph.
You look like you're in very good health.

1270
01:17:25.121 --> 01:17:28.193
I don't look like anything.
What do you want to tell me, talker?

1271
01:17:28.595 --> 01:17:33.349
Good. Listen.
I have rather bad news I'm afraid.

1272
01:17:34.445 --> 01:17:37.404
But I may have some good news.
I'm not saying that...

1273
01:17:37.554 --> 01:17:39.703
-it's sure...
-Out with it.

1274
01:17:41.027 --> 01:17:43.335
I pleaded as best I could in front
of the tribunal.

1275
01:17:43.586 --> 01:17:44.496
I even thought...

1276
01:17:44.682 --> 01:17:46.673
I just want to know the results.

1277
01:17:47.609 --> 01:17:48.564
Well,

1278
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:53.380
To pay the damages to all claimants,

1279
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.551
Your bank account was not enough.

1280
01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:57.532
We had to confiscate,

1281
01:17:58.029 --> 01:17:59.666
and auction off...

1282
01:18:00.405 --> 01:18:01.838
Not my mother's house...?

1283
01:18:03.514 --> 01:18:04.503
My mother's house?

1284
01:18:05.707 --> 01:18:08.585
Joseph, your mother has been dead for years...

1285
01:18:08.815 --> 01:18:09.725
So what?

1286
01:18:10.278 --> 01:18:11.630
I bought it for her!

1287
01:18:12.836 --> 01:18:13.871
We only have one mother!

1288
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.289
Please, Jo.

1289
01:18:16.675 --> 01:18:17.585
Behave.

1290
01:18:22.344 --> 01:18:23.618
I got nothing left?

1291
01:18:29.108 --> 01:18:30.063
Joseph!

1292
01:18:30.204 --> 01:18:32.115
Don't you want to hear the good news?

1293
01:18:32.398 --> 01:18:35.197
That if I'm a good boy,
I'll see my sentence reduced?

1294
01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:38.261
Since I'm polite, I won't tell you
where you can put your reduction..

1295
01:18:38.979 --> 01:18:40.298
I wish you good day.

1296
01:18:48.487 --> 01:18:49.396
Is that you, Marie?

1297
01:18:50.315 --> 01:18:51.542
How did you guess?

1298
01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:54.248
I'm glad you're here.

1299
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:56.922
It could only be you.

1300
01:18:58.175 --> 01:18:59.404
I like your smile.

1301
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:04.649
How do you find me,
better or worse?

1302
01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:07.811
I prefer your real hair colour.

1303
01:19:08.779 --> 01:19:11.167
But this is nice too.

1304
01:19:12.618 --> 01:19:14.255
I love them; I wear them all the time.

1305
01:19:16.639 --> 01:19:18.039
Have you been living here for long?

1306
01:19:18.469 --> 01:19:19.697
It'll soon be 12 years.

1307
01:19:21.028 --> 01:19:24.020
-And you never felt like leaving?
-Yes, often.

1308
01:19:29.438 --> 01:19:33.112
It's beautiful here.
But why did you not leave?

1309
01:19:38.396 --> 01:19:39.715
Show me your house.

1310
01:19:57.408 --> 01:19:58.363
Is it a portrait of your girlfriend?

1311
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.693
I don't have a girlfriend.

1312
01:20:02.893 --> 01:20:05.167
But you must have known many women
during your life.

1313
01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:08.219
A few, but they did not matter.

1314
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.989
Why do you live alone?
Why are you not married?

1315
01:20:12.948 --> 01:20:15.064
Probably because I did not find the right woman.

1316
01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:16.677
You ask many questions!

1317
01:20:18.067 --> 01:20:19.341
My turn to ask you a question.

1318
01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:21.796
Who was that soldat with you the other day?

1319
01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:24.703
B�bert? A friend, nothing more.

1320
01:20:25.014 --> 01:20:26.572
There you go, no need to get excited.

1321
01:20:26.658 --> 01:20:27.978
That's exactly what I thought.

1322
01:20:28.121 --> 01:20:32.161
I slept late last night. My bosses were having a party.
And alcohol makes me sleepy.

1323
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:35.228
Just a drop. To make peace.

1324
01:20:40.371 --> 01:20:42.042
I'm not angry with you, you know.

1325
01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:45.047
I just don't want you to imagine things.

1326
01:20:46.769 --> 01:20:49.202
I would never go with a man before marriage. Never.

1327
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.295
You believe me?

1328
01:20:53.167 --> 01:20:54.317
Of course I do.

1329
01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.623
Well... Cheers

1330
01:21:08.523 --> 01:21:09.434
May I smoke?

1331
01:21:09.804 --> 01:21:10.872
As much as you want.

1332
01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:15.289
Garris, Garris! Come!

1333
01:21:15.654 --> 01:21:19.362
Forgive me. My neighbours went to the village,
I must watch over their kids.

1334
01:21:22.052 --> 01:21:24.247
-What's the matter?
-Cri-Cri is gone.

1335
01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:25.657
-Which way?
-This way.

1336
01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:39.344
Come here darling. It's over

1337
01:21:39.421 --> 01:21:42.458
Run and get Dr Legars.
His house is at the bottom of the hill before town.

1338
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.900
Cough.

1339
01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.278
Again.

1340
01:21:56.056 --> 01:21:57.012
Is it serious?

1341
01:21:57.702 --> 01:22:01.456
If it turns into a pneumonia, it can be.
She needs medication immediately.

1342
01:22:03.735 --> 01:22:07.329
-What has she done this time?
-Nothing. Can't you see she's sick?

1343
01:22:09.403 --> 01:22:10.199
My little Cri-Cri.

1344
01:22:15.253 --> 01:22:17.369
Not too much medication, Doctor,
we don't have much.

1345
01:22:17.811 --> 01:22:19.722
Enough to buy a ridiculous hat!

1346
01:22:20.005 --> 01:22:21.439
Give Cri-Cri whatever she needs,
I will pay.

1347
01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:40.164
All this is this bloody Riton's fault.

1348
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.996
Riton, always Riton!
That one, he has ruined my life proper!

1349
01:22:45.235 --> 01:22:47.953
A chicken. That's what he is. A Chicken.

1350
01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:50.354
On top of which he is stupid. Really stupid.

1351
01:22:51.449 --> 01:22:53.600
Couldn't he watch his kids himself?

1352
01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:56.077
And of all days he had to go to town today.

1353
01:22:56.203 --> 01:22:59.833
As soon as the girl is feeling better,
I take my things and leave.

1354
01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:04.503
Anywhere. Far from here,
far from Mr Pignole and his family.

1355
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:06.619
And Marie...

1356
01:23:07.538 --> 01:23:09.574
She did not even recognise herself
on the portrait.

1357
01:23:10.462 --> 01:23:11.497
She must have left unhappy.

1358
01:23:11.559 --> 01:23:14.551
For once she comes to visit,
and I leave her alone and don't come back.

1359
01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:18.262
-Shit! Shit!
-Garris, You must come.

1360
01:23:18.506 --> 01:23:20.145
-Beat it. Leave me be.
-No

1361
01:23:20.153 --> 01:23:23.862
It's for Cri-Cri. I gave her the syrup
but I cannot manage with the pills.

1362
01:23:24.175 --> 01:23:26.051
Manage on your own.
I want peace.

1363
01:23:40.994 --> 01:23:42.472
Let's go, you irritant.

1364
01:23:45.199 --> 01:23:47.155
Higher! Higher!

1365
01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:49.948
Pass it to me! No!
Higher, higher!

1366
01:23:52.693 --> 01:23:54.570
You made this kite, p�p�?

1367
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:56.219
Gives me something to do.

1368
01:23:56.716 --> 01:24:00.025
Since Pierrot left for holidays, I'm bored.

1369
01:24:00.737 --> 01:24:02.376
I know someone else who misses him too.

1370
01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:08.824
-P�p�, thanks for all the...
-It's my pleasure.

1371
01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.630
It will be a welcome change from
the usual beans.

1372
01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:13.759
How is Garris?

1373
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.253
Not good these days.

1374
01:24:15.363 --> 01:24:16.637
Why is that?

1375
01:24:16.826 --> 01:24:20.613
Garris sometimes needs to be alone,
and it's best to leave him be.

1376
01:24:21.396 --> 01:24:23.829
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Your Garris is in love.

1377
01:24:23.956 --> 01:24:24.865
That's all.

1378
01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:26.771
Maybe, but that's none of your business.

1379
01:24:39.677 --> 01:24:43.148
You're looking for the Loiseau?
They left to spend the summer in Nice.

1380
01:24:43.699 --> 01:24:46.055
ACtually I was looking for their maid.

1381
01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:47.453
Marie?

1382
01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:48.631
They took her with them.

1383
01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:51.118
Did they tell you when they're coming back?

1384
01:24:51.744 --> 01:24:54.052
Previous years September,

1385
01:24:54.485 --> 01:24:55.680
Sometimes October.

1386
01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:58.532
-Thank you, Madam.
-You're welcome.

1387
01:25:03.809 --> 01:25:06.960
Crir-cri. So nice to see you
back to normal.

1388
01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:10.792
-Can I tell you something?
-Of course.

1389
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.372
It's regarding Pierrot.

1390
01:25:12.768 --> 01:25:13.677
Your brother?

1391
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:15.630
No, the one from the city.

1392
01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:19.431
I think I'm in love with him.

1393
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:22.640
Really? Are you sure?

1394
01:25:22.823 --> 01:25:24.175
Well, no.

1395
01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:26.757
What does it feel like to be in love?

1396
01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:28.849
Why do you ask me?

1397
01:25:29.221 --> 01:25:30.780
Because you're in love too.

1398
01:25:31.233 --> 01:25:32.426
Who told you that?

1399
01:25:33.244 --> 01:25:36.520
Mommy. She said we don't see you anymore
because you're in love.

1400
01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:40.988
What's it like? We're happy and sad?
Is that it?

1401
01:25:41.104 --> 01:25:43.778
Yes, it's more or less like that.

1402
01:25:44.212 --> 01:25:45.565
You're a very clever girl.

1403
01:25:51.708 --> 01:25:53.027
Hello, Raymond.

1404
01:25:58.289 --> 01:25:59.324
Hello.

1405
01:25:59.752 --> 01:26:01.184
Hola, Hyacinth.

1406
01:26:01.945 --> 01:26:03.936
You're very handsome today.

1407
01:26:04.322 --> 01:26:07.280
-My daughter forces me, as you know.
-Yes, Yes.

1408
01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:09.912
What do you bet I still know
how to do this?

1409
01:26:10.354 --> 01:26:11.264
Go ahead.

1410
01:26:16.206 --> 01:26:18.355
You are still pretty good at it.

1411
01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:21.271
Remember when we used to do this together?

1412
01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:26.070
Feels like yesterday.

1413
01:26:32.110 --> 01:26:33.305
What can I do for you...?

1414
01:26:33.573 --> 01:26:35.609
-I need a favour.
-Yes.

1415
01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:38.384
I need you to write a bearer's cheque for me.

1416
01:26:38.692 --> 01:26:39.726
That's easy!

1417
01:26:41.434 --> 01:26:42.628
There.

1418
01:26:46.005 --> 01:26:46.960
Good.

1419
01:26:48.199 --> 01:26:50.155
-How much?
-1,000 francs

1420
01:26:53.135 --> 01:26:56.604
-Where are you going?
-What do you think? Going to work.

1421
01:26:56.974 --> 01:26:59.123
They need men at Testud's place, to work
with the harvesting machine.

1422
01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:03.722
No need to do any more work for me,
P�p� gave me a cheque.

1423
01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:06.110
Show me?

1424
01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:09.702
1,000 francs!
That's too much.

1425
01:27:09.953 --> 01:27:11.706
We'll never be able
to pay him back.

1426
01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:13.684
That's not my style.

1427
01:27:13.792 --> 01:27:14.942
He does not want us to pay him back.

1428
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:16.974
We swamp people, we live off nothing.

1429
01:27:19.643 --> 01:27:21.076
the bourgeois will not like that.

1430
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:23.063
they will think it's irregular.

1431
01:27:24.396 --> 01:27:26.989
It will appear improper, and P�p�
will have problems with his family.

1432
01:27:28.052 --> 01:27:29.884
We'll return him his cheque tonight.

1433
01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:32.920
I could have put these 1,000 Francs to good use.

1434
01:27:33.353 --> 01:27:35.788
You won't be short of anything.
I'll work.

1435
01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:37.610
I will deliver coal.

1436
01:27:38.289 --> 01:27:39.927
Coal? that's too tough for me.

1437
01:27:40.119 --> 01:27:42.314
I said 'I' would deliver coal.

1438
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.896
You will go fishing.

1439
01:27:48.894 --> 01:27:50.725
Not his style, not his style.

1440
01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:54.922
My style is to be human.

1441
01:28:06.993 --> 01:28:07.948
Ready!

1442
01:28:15.219 --> 01:28:16.448
Do you have some shoe polish?

1443
01:28:16.864 --> 01:28:19.503
We don't have enough to eat and
you want some shoe polish?

1444
01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.759
You really have a nasty disposition.

1445
01:28:32.952 --> 01:28:35.342
Riton is dressed like a gentleman!

1446
01:28:36.975 --> 01:28:38.202
Oh the sneaky one!

1447
01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:42.880
Testud, can I take one hour off?
I'll work later tonight.

1448
01:28:43.007 --> 01:28:44.077
Go ahead.

1449
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.864
No, not him!

1450
01:28:47.761 --> 01:28:48.716
Where are you going?

1451
01:28:51.051 --> 01:28:52.882
Taking a walk. I was just passing through.

1452
01:28:53.063 --> 01:28:55.337
Of course. That's why you're wearing a tie.

1453
01:28:57.085 --> 01:28:57.994
Hand over the cheque.

1454
01:29:01.655 --> 01:29:03.167
We can't cash it. The negro is there.

1455
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.289
Banania!

1456
01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:05.672
You're afraid of him?

1457
01:29:07.139 --> 01:29:08.050
Come with me.

1458
01:29:13.354 --> 01:29:16.028
-Hello, buddy.
-Hello, buddy. Happy to see you.

1459
01:29:19.023 --> 01:29:20.661
Are you nuts!

1460
01:29:21.764 --> 01:29:22.640
Sir.

1461
01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:24.992
1,000 Francs to the bearer.

1462
01:29:25.237 --> 01:29:26.148
Is that it?

1463
01:29:28.164 --> 01:29:29.074
My goodness!

1464
01:29:30.539 --> 01:29:31.574
Say thank you.

1465
01:29:31.819 --> 01:29:32.969
Thank you very much, sir.

1466
01:29:34.195 --> 01:29:35.230
And now?

1467
01:29:35.842 --> 01:29:38.230
We cashed in the cheque.
Isn't that what you wanted?

1468
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.356
Now we return P�p� his money.

1469
01:29:40.778 --> 01:29:41.688
What?

1470
01:29:43.155 --> 01:29:44.110
Hello.

1471
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:45.206
Your cap.

1472
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:46.565
We are friends of P�p�. Is he in?

1473
01:29:46.994 --> 01:29:47.983
We'd like to talk to him.

1474
01:29:48.456 --> 01:29:49.444
He's not in.

1475
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:52.615
He went to run an errand but
he should be back shortly.

1476
01:29:52.844 --> 01:29:54.402
We'll wait for him outside.

1477
01:29:54.854 --> 01:29:55.764
Ok.

1478
01:29:55.952 --> 01:29:59.262
Oh, what a surprise,
these are friends of mine.

1479
01:29:59.608 --> 01:30:02.202
Put them in the living room. Come on.

1480
01:30:02.716 --> 01:30:04.434
Come in, put yourselves at ease.

1481
01:30:04.543 --> 01:30:07.012
Sit down.
Berthe, aperitifs!

1482
01:30:09.297 --> 01:30:11.605
-We did not want to disturb you.
-You are not disturbing at all.

1483
01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:13.949
What brings you here?

1484
01:30:18.255 --> 01:30:19.210
This.

1485
01:30:21.912 --> 01:30:22.947
What is this?

1486
01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:24.260
Your money.

1487
01:30:25.568 --> 01:30:27.922
Why are you returning it?

1488
01:30:29.407 --> 01:30:30.476
It's my money.

1489
01:30:31.235 --> 01:30:32.554
I do what I please with it.

1490
01:30:35.256 --> 01:30:38.248
Berthe, set this down here
and leave us, please.

1491
01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.523
You must understand,

1492
01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:47.117
We may be poor, but we're proud.

1493
01:30:47.139 --> 01:30:49.529
If someone does something for us,
we must pay back.

1494
01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:52.262
Otherwise, we're not even poor,

1495
01:30:53.172 --> 01:30:54.400
we're miserable.

1496
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.585
No. I don't understand.

1497
01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.395
Then you must have forgotten.

1498
01:31:05.422 --> 01:31:07.298
Hello, father, am I intruding?

1499
01:31:07.432 --> 01:31:10.185
Of course not, son in law.

1500
01:31:10.541 --> 01:31:13.373
Let me introduce two of my friends,
Messrs Garris and Riton.

1501
01:31:13.466 --> 01:31:14.944
People of the swamp,

1502
01:31:15.293 --> 01:31:16.248
like me.

1503
01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:21.630
They came here tonight to return money
that I lent them.

1504
01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.710
You see, Laurent,
people of the swamp are honest.

1505
01:31:26.262 --> 01:31:29.335
Unlike all those clients whose ass you kiss constantly.

1506
01:31:29.737 --> 01:31:30.886
Isn't that true, Laurent?

1507
01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:33.704
My friends, let me show you out.

1508
01:31:34.306 --> 01:31:37.219
It's not true,
you are not my friends.

1509
01:31:38.512 --> 01:31:39.706
I have no more friends.

1510
01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.439
Come on, tell me.
Tell me what you think.

1511
01:31:54.782 --> 01:31:56.375
What I think is that you are right.

1512
01:31:56.793 --> 01:31:58.943
We may be poor, but
we're not miserable.

1513
01:32:01.181 --> 01:32:04.650
There are days when I am real happy
to know you, Mr. Riton.

1514
01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:07.056
The rest of the year, how is it?

1515
01:32:07.579 --> 01:32:08.773
I'm still happy.

1516
01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:14.085
With all this we missed our aperitif.

1517
01:32:14.344 --> 01:32:17.096
I'm gonna buy you an aperitif
you won't soon forget.

1518
01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:18.956
Aperitif, here we come!

1519
01:32:19.096 --> 01:32:23.136
Jo, I came to tell you...
6 months

1520
01:32:23.301 --> 01:32:24.256
it's a long time.

1521
01:32:24.398 --> 01:32:26.195
-Long for whom?
-For you,

1522
01:32:26.775 --> 01:32:27.844
For you, Jo.

1523
01:32:29.701 --> 01:32:30.610
And for me.

1524
01:32:32.626 --> 01:32:33.819
Well, Jo,

1525
01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:35.498
I met someone.

1526
01:32:35.916 --> 01:32:38.750
What do you want me to do? Cry?

1527
01:32:39.755 --> 01:32:42.554
What do I care...
Go with whom you please.

1528
01:32:43.047 --> 01:32:44.639
I left some cigarettes.

1529
01:32:45.056 --> 01:32:47.490
Thank you. You will have been kind
until the end.

1530
01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.454
September came and went,

1531
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:52.603
like every September month does.

1532
01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:55.664
Garris brought me to town one afternoon,

1533
01:32:56.574 --> 01:32:59.372
a beautiful afternoon I would never forget.

1534
01:33:03.155 --> 01:33:04.190
Pierrot! You're back!

1535
01:33:04.435 --> 01:33:06.188
Yes, school has started.

1536
01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.164
Don't you want to come in, my dear boy?

1537
01:33:08.824 --> 01:33:09.939
If my grandfather is ok with it...

1538
01:33:10.103 --> 01:33:11.774
Mr. Richard, Come in with him.

1539
01:33:11.931 --> 01:33:13.364
It would make me so happy.

1540
01:33:24.362 --> 01:33:25.637
Mr. Richard,

1541
01:33:25.826 --> 01:33:29.023
May I introduce Mr. Am�d�e
and Mr. Garris.

1542
01:33:29.115 --> 01:33:30.025
We know each other.

1543
01:33:30.762 --> 01:33:31.956
We are good friends.

1544
01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:33.360
And great frog lovers.

1545
01:33:35.148 --> 01:33:37.868
I'll fetch some wine,
and some snacks for the kids.

1546
01:33:38.256 --> 01:33:39.166
I'll go with you.

1547
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:49.460
We've missed you, you know.

1548
01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.153
I was the one who was punished the most.

1549
01:33:52.699 --> 01:33:55.167
By the way, 15 December is Tane's birthday.

1550
01:33:55.625 --> 01:33:58.422
We do a big dinner at my place.
Will you come?

1551
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:59.460
Of course I will.

1552
01:33:59.829 --> 01:34:02.503
-Who is Tane?
-The driver of the black forest train.

1553
01:34:02.755 --> 01:34:04.585
A nice guy. You will like him.

1554
01:34:04.949 --> 01:34:07.542
My husband must have known him.
He knew everyone.

1555
01:34:08.788 --> 01:34:09.743
These two are cute.

1556
01:34:10.615 --> 01:34:14.130
They are happy to see each other again.
You brought her along on purpose?

1557
01:34:16.466 --> 01:34:19.980
"...and the green paradise of children's love,

1558
01:34:21.219 --> 01:34:22.777
the innocent eden,

1559
01:34:23.047 --> 01:34:24.958
filled with furtive pleasures..."

1560
01:34:25.972 --> 01:34:30.251
"Is it now further than India and China?

1561
01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.750
Can we recall it with plaintive cries?

1562
01:34:34.381 --> 01:34:37.896
and animate it with a silvery voice,...

1563
01:34:38.404 --> 01:34:42.192
the innocent eden, filled with furtive pleasures."

1564
01:34:44.253 --> 01:34:45.208
Bravo!

1565
01:34:45.351 --> 01:34:46.578
It was beautiful.

1566
01:34:54.309 --> 01:34:55.219
Yes?

1567
01:34:56.137 --> 01:34:57.047
Can I help you?

1568
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.988
Sorry to intrude,
I would like to talk to the maid.

1569
01:35:00.342 --> 01:35:01.252
That's me.

1570
01:35:02.536 --> 01:35:03.934
I meant Marie.

1571
01:35:04.181 --> 01:35:07.617
She does not work here anymore. I'm replacing her.
During the holidays,

1572
01:35:07.837 --> 01:35:10.146
she met a pharmacist, in Nice.

1573
01:35:10.396 --> 01:35:11.909
Not very young, but very rich.

1574
01:35:12.407 --> 01:35:16.083
In no time it was done:
the ring, the mayor, the priest.

1575
01:35:17.161 --> 01:35:19.072
You mean she got married?

1576
01:35:19.904 --> 01:35:20.859
Just like that.

1577
01:35:21.548 --> 01:35:22.664
Can you believe her luck?

1578
01:35:23.377 --> 01:35:25.173
Are you related, a friend maybe?

1579
01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.904
A friend yes, kindof.

1580
01:35:32.884 --> 01:35:33.838
See you, Jo.

1581
01:35:34.345 --> 01:35:37.496
I like you, Jo.
I don't want to say 'see you soon'

1582
01:35:37.637 --> 01:35:38.592
Then don't say it.

1583
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:41.822
Hey, Jo. Nice to see you free.

1584
01:35:42.389 --> 01:35:44.345
-Hug?
-And what else!

1585
01:35:44.949 --> 01:35:47.621
-Nippy
-Wait, I got lots of clothes in the car.

1586
01:35:48.422 --> 01:35:49.538
Everything I could salvage.

1587
01:35:50.251 --> 01:35:51.444
What are you going to do now?

1588
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:52.930
I know perfectly well what I will do.

1589
01:35:53.359 --> 01:35:54.347
Be reasonable.

1590
01:35:54.639 --> 01:35:56.994
That rat-face was piss drunk.

1591
01:35:57.198 --> 01:35:59.393
-I'm going to kill him.
-Kill him? How so?

1592
01:35:59.574 --> 01:36:00.769
-It's hunting season right?
-Yes

1593
01:36:01.951 --> 01:36:03.668
Hunting accident. It happens.

1594
01:36:04.327 --> 01:36:07.797
If you get caught, you don't get 6 months;
you lose your head.

1595
01:36:08.166 --> 01:36:09.121
Let's go.

1596
01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:18.766
P�p�!

1597
01:36:19.318 --> 01:36:21.195
Garris!

1598
01:36:21.878 --> 01:36:24.268
-I am doing a delivery in the high district.
Shall I drop you off? -Ok.

1599
01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.460
Sorry I'm not shaking your hand. Coal...

1600
01:36:28.643 --> 01:36:30.155
Mind if I take the leash?

1601
01:36:33.396 --> 01:36:37.469
Bourricot was not exactly like that.
He had a temper.

1602
01:36:37.783 --> 01:36:39.057
I wanted to tell you.

1603
01:36:39.246 --> 01:36:42.203
I won't be able to make 
Tane's birthday dinner.

1604
01:36:42.353 --> 01:36:44.072
It's the date the family has chosen

1605
01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:47.800
for the engagement of Catherine, my grand-daughter.

1606
01:36:47.838 --> 01:36:50.512
Engagement is during the day.
You can come out at night.

1607
01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:54.518
I will try, but this sort of
dead boring celebrations

1608
01:36:54.603 --> 01:36:56.672
can last until 2 am.

1609
01:36:56.797 --> 01:36:58.434
Who is Catherine marrying?

1610
01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:02.074
An awful man.
Similar to my son-in-law.

1611
01:37:02.646 --> 01:37:04.557
She won't have fun everyday.

1612
01:37:04.657 --> 01:37:08.697
Fortunately, she's different.
She'll understand pretty quickly.

1613
01:37:08.862 --> 01:37:11.252
If you'd like to bet. This idiot Lucien,

1614
01:37:11.788 --> 01:37:14.621
within a year he'll be wearing horns.

1615
01:37:30.434 --> 01:37:32.903
Santa Claus! Your bear!

1616
01:37:36.467 --> 01:37:37.378
Wait!

1617
01:37:39.393 --> 01:37:41.952
Why do you run away like this?
Do I scare you?

1618
01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:43.934
You thought I was someone else?

1619
01:37:44.328 --> 01:37:47.240
I mean you no harm.
See? You lost a bear!

1620
01:37:47.802 --> 01:37:49.360
There. Happy holidays.

1621
01:37:49.996 --> 01:37:53.511
I too did some shit jobs when I was young,
like 'sandwich-man'.

1622
01:37:53.835 --> 01:37:54.824
'sandwich-man'!

1623
01:37:58.953 --> 01:38:00.103
The bastard!

1624
01:38:10.289 --> 01:38:12.756
Wait, Santa Claus! Wait!

1625
01:38:12.847 --> 01:38:14.679
His name is Henri Pignole.

1626
01:38:14.859 --> 01:38:16.895
Unfortunately, I have no address for him.

1627
01:38:17.235 --> 01:38:18.827
He was recommended by...

1628
01:38:20.891 --> 01:38:21.801
a Mr. Richard.

1629
01:38:21.806 --> 01:38:24.115
Where can I find this Mr. Richard?

1630
01:38:24.914 --> 01:38:26.744
At his house, Marshall Fayolle Street.

1631
01:38:30.764 --> 01:38:32.595
Daddy, please!

1632
01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:35.190
Let me have my fianc�.

1633
01:38:36.614 --> 01:38:37.684
Gentlemen, if you please.

1634
01:38:38.809 --> 01:38:40.878
Mr Mayor, what do you think of this Adolf Hitler?

1635
01:38:41.002 --> 01:38:44.630
He's a strong man. He will be chancelor soon.
And then...

1636
01:38:44.841 --> 01:38:48.880
He will re-arm Germany, then war.

1637
01:38:49.046 --> 01:38:51.798
A good little war is not bad for business, 
isn't it, Laurent?

1638
01:38:55.993 --> 01:38:57.345
-Granny, you're ok?
-Yes.

1639
01:38:57.456 --> 01:38:58.524
Here comes the horned one

1640
01:38:58.735 --> 01:38:59.851
-What?
-Nothing.

1641
01:39:00.014 --> 01:39:00.969
I told that man

1642
01:39:01.112 --> 01:39:03.306
"If you really want to be my lover

1643
01:39:03.672 --> 01:39:05.742
you will have to duel against my husband"

1644
01:39:06.047 --> 01:39:07.765
-Do you know what he did?
-I don't give a shit.

1645
01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.073
-I beg yor pardon?
-I don't give a shit.

1646
01:39:16.103 --> 01:39:17.092
Did you stab in some garlic at least?

1647
01:39:17.565 --> 01:39:18.681
Yes, Mr. Pignole.

1648
01:39:20.125 --> 01:39:21.239
It smells real good.

1649
01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:29.626
What's wrong, Riton?

1650
01:39:30.728 --> 01:39:33.323
-The boxer is back.
-So what?

1651
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:35.029
It worries me, that's all.

1652
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:37.257
Let him come, your boxer.

1653
01:39:42.612 --> 01:39:44.648
This time, winter
has really started!

1654
01:39:47.364 --> 01:39:48.274
Sorry

1655
01:39:52.484 --> 01:39:54.155
I would like to see Mr. Richard, please.

1656
01:39:54.494 --> 01:39:55.530
I'm his son-in-law.

1657
01:39:56.139 --> 01:39:58.414
As you can see, we are in the midst
of a function.

1658
01:40:00.344 --> 01:40:03.416
-May I know the reason for your visit?
-Pignolle,

1659
01:40:04.367 --> 01:40:06.800
Riton Pignolle.
Does that ring a bell?

1660
01:40:07.291 --> 01:40:08.610
Come, Mr. Richard.

1661
01:40:09.119 --> 01:40:11.680
-What's the matter?
-A tall, brown-hair man. Looks nasty.

1662
01:40:12.228 --> 01:40:14.139
-I don't know him.
-Please go and have a look.

1663
01:40:14.238 --> 01:40:17.435
Don't let the other idiot
speak for you.

1664
01:40:18.261 --> 01:40:20.934
Please excuse me.
Ah, sorry.

1665
01:40:25.755 --> 01:40:28.270
-What did he want?
-Nothing much.

1666
01:40:28.681 --> 01:40:30.592
Just to know the address
of one of your friends

1667
01:40:30.693 --> 01:40:33.253
from 'over there'.
A certain Riton, I believe.

1668
01:40:33.434 --> 01:40:34.423
You told him?

1669
01:40:35.445 --> 01:40:37.198
I have nothing to hide. Why not?

1670
01:40:37.273 --> 01:40:40.185
Idiot!
What's his business with Riton?

1671
01:40:40.381 --> 01:40:43.373
Nothing good, I think.

1672
01:40:43.672 --> 01:40:44.583
Nothing good.

1673
01:40:52.264 --> 01:40:55.894
Happy birthday to you,

1674
01:40:56.287 --> 01:40:59.881
happy birthday to you...

1675
01:41:05.061 --> 01:41:06.780
Come on, blow the years away.

1676
01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:10.856
Well done! Cheers!

1677
01:41:11.278 --> 01:41:12.233
Cheers!

1678
01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:14.541
Thanks, guys.

1679
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:17.827
What a pity p�p� could not make it.

1680
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:20.192
-He can still make it.
-At this hour? Don't think so.

1681
01:41:20.601 --> 01:41:22.239
Let's drink to his health.

1682
01:41:22.246 --> 01:41:23.805
To p�p�'s health!

1683
01:42:08.864 --> 01:42:10.014
He won't come, at this hour.

1684
01:42:11.242 --> 01:42:13.198
Close the door, we're freezing.

1685
01:42:35.738 --> 01:42:37.969
-Good morning madam.
-Good morning.

1686
01:42:38.481 --> 01:42:39.436
Is Pierrot in?

1687
01:42:41.041 --> 01:42:41.951
Please come in.

1688
01:42:47.805 --> 01:42:48.715
Pierrot.

1689
01:42:53.472 --> 01:42:56.146
Pierrot.

1690
01:42:57.676 --> 01:42:58.586
Hello, Pierrot.

1691
01:42:58.773 --> 01:42:59.684
Hello.

1692
01:43:04.076 --> 01:43:06.795
It's a fake one. It's for you.

1693
01:43:08.463 --> 01:43:10.375
Your grandfather was a champion frog fisherman.

1694
01:43:11.753 --> 01:43:13.233
And he ate them alive.

1695
01:43:15.411 --> 01:43:16.320
Be strong.

1696
01:43:17.604 --> 01:43:18.559
Madam.

1697
01:43:19.432 --> 01:43:20.387
Sir.

1698
01:43:30.402 --> 01:43:31.994
-Do you live here, little one?
-Yes.

1699
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:33.264
Do you know Riton Pignole?

1700
01:43:33.692 --> 01:43:34.726
He's my father.

1701
01:43:34.971 --> 01:43:36.690
Do you know where he is?

1702
01:43:37.349 --> 01:43:38.827
Near the pond. He's fishing.

1703
01:43:40.457 --> 01:43:41.525
You look nasty.

1704
01:43:51.609 --> 01:43:52.644
Don't do that.

1705
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:54.550
You bet I will!

1706
01:43:54.898 --> 01:43:58.208
I've been thinking about it for months!

1707
01:43:58.737 --> 01:44:00.693
First I'll shoot off your balls,

1708
01:44:00.931 --> 01:44:02.762
then I will watch you suffer for a while.

1709
01:44:02.943 --> 01:44:04.262
Just for pleasure.

1710
01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:07.568
And when I feel like it,
I'll shoot your face off.

1711
01:44:09.707 --> 01:44:10.695
I'm sinking!

1712
01:44:10.987 --> 01:44:13.023
Shit, I'm thinking!
Get me out�!

1713
01:44:15.009 --> 01:44:16.043
Grab this!

1714
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:21.539
I don't want to die like this!

1715
01:44:22.139 --> 01:44:23.538
I don't want to die like this!

1716
01:44:26.891 --> 01:44:27.801
Grab on!

1717
01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:30.391
Pull! Pull!

1718
01:44:32.193 --> 01:44:33.148
Pull harder.

1719
01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:37.282
My leg!

1720
01:44:38.043 --> 01:44:40.193
Cri-Cri, bring the gentleman
to my place.

1721
01:44:42.613 --> 01:44:43.523
My leg!

1722
01:44:46.636 --> 01:44:48.193
My leg is broken!

1723
01:45:05.467 --> 01:45:06.377
How is he?

1724
01:45:08.208 --> 01:45:09.926
Like someone whose leg is broken.

1725
01:45:11.864 --> 01:45:12.774
Is he in pain?

1726
01:45:15.155 --> 01:45:16.668
You should have thought about the pain
beforehand.

1727
01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:22.725
I've never been so scared in my life.

1728
01:45:24.479 --> 01:45:25.514
Never.

1729
01:45:27.039 --> 01:45:27.949
I understand.

1730
01:45:28.867 --> 01:45:30.858
A lost cow once fell in.

1731
01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:33.621
We tried everything.
the poor thing sunk in,

1732
01:45:34.534 --> 01:45:38.210
sunk in.... Slowly
suffocated to death.

1733
01:45:39.835 --> 01:45:40.985
Horrible, no?

1734
01:45:41.298 --> 01:45:42.288
My goodness!

1735
01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.114
Alright, I need to get back to the hospital
to look in on Riton.

1736
01:45:51.902 --> 01:45:52.811
See you later.

1737
01:45:55.923 --> 01:45:57.118
You can wear this.

1738
01:46:01.408 --> 01:46:02.762
Tell him I'll visit him tomorrow.

1739
01:46:03.967 --> 01:46:04.922
Tell him thank you.

1740
01:46:07.989 --> 01:46:09.139
That I would do anything for him.

1741
01:46:12.012 --> 01:46:12.922
Anything.

1742
01:46:13.657 --> 01:46:15.408
I'll tell him, buddy.

1743
01:46:18.592 --> 01:46:20.663
There you have it, the whole story.

1744
01:46:21.701 --> 01:46:23.213
Time has since passed.

1745
01:46:23.711 --> 01:46:26.180
Many things were told to me,
I didn't witness them first hand.

1746
01:46:26.454 --> 01:46:28.332
Maybe I distort a little bit.

1747
01:46:28.466 --> 01:46:31.697
Most of those I met that year
are gone, of course.

1748
01:46:32.305 --> 01:46:33.215
Hey, friend!

1749
01:46:33.402 --> 01:46:34.630
Others too.

1750
01:46:35.413 --> 01:46:36.448
What does it matter.

1751
01:46:37.605 --> 01:46:41.315
Our father and Jo Sordi, both equally stupid,
could only get on well.

1752
01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:43.858
They became inseparable.

1753
01:46:44.371 --> 01:46:46.805
Jo became boxing manager, dad was corner man.

1754
01:46:48.574 --> 01:46:49.530
They died together,

1755
01:46:49.672 --> 01:46:53.380
in Lyons, under the bombs in May 44.

1756
01:46:54.425 --> 01:46:57.304
3 years later I married Pierrot.
I was 20.

1757
01:46:57.532 --> 01:47:00.889
He became a famous doctor,
and thank God, he's still alive.

1758
01:47:01.372 --> 01:47:03.443
The small frog Garris gave him
never leaves his pocket.

1759
01:47:05.211 --> 01:47:08.283
You will of course wonder
what became of Garris.

1760
01:47:10.695 --> 01:47:12.925
He left on a spring day.

1761
01:47:18.375 --> 01:47:20.524
No one ever heard from him again.

1762
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.018
But I'm pretty sure

1763
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:27.065
that he walked towards the sun,
went to Nice,

1764
01:47:27.514 --> 01:47:29.425
and eloped with a pharmacist's wife.

1765
01:47:32.817 --> 01:47:33.806
As for the swamp,

1766
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.556
It's been drained long ago to make space
for a world of fools.

1767
01:47:38.484 --> 01:47:40.838
There are times in life

1768
01:47:41.043 --> 01:47:43.193
when you'd want everything
to remain the same forever.
