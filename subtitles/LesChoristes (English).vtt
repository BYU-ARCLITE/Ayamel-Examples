1
00:41.798 --> 00:43.100
Come in, please.

2
00:44.100 --> 00:46.700
Pierre, it's a call from France,
it's urgent.

3
00:48.298 --> 00:50.100
After the concert.

4
00:54.100 --> 00:56.500
It's about your mother.

5
01:03.500 --> 01:05.500
Yes?

6
01:17.501 --> 01:23.501
Chorists

7
02:59.500 --> 03:01.699
Do you recognise me?

8
03:03.699 --> 03:08.199
Pond Bottom, my father will pick me up on Saturday.

9
03:09.500 --> 03:11.098
Pepinot

10
03:12.098 --> 03:13.900
But of course.

11
03:14.800 --> 03:18.000
Pepinot! How long has it been?

12
03:18.400 --> 03:21.598
Only 50 years.

13
03:23.000 --> 03:25.199
Pond Bottom.

14
03:27.500 --> 03:30.300
There you are, the short one in the first row.

15
03:30.500 --> 03:32.000
And this is you.

16
03:33.199 --> 03:35.199
And the prefect, what was his name?

17
03:35.300 --> 03:37.098
Clement Mathieu

18
03:37.400 --> 03:39.800
Clement Mathieu

19
03:40.900 --> 03:43.199
What became of him?

20
03:45.199 --> 03:46.800
Open it.

21
03:51.598 --> 03:54.300
Pond Bottom-- year 1949

22
03:55.098 --> 03:58.800
This is the diary kept by Mathieu,
about his days at Pond Bottom.

23
03:59.000 --> 04:01.699
About his story, and ours too.

24
04:03.098 --> 04:04.800
He wanted you to have it.

25
04:05.000 --> 04:08.900
I'd prefer to give it to you
under happier circumstances but...

26
04:13.098 --> 04:15.199
1949, Jan. 15th.

27
04:16.199 --> 04:18.899
After a few years of failure,

28
04:19.699 --> 04:22.699
I was certain the worst was yet to come.

29
04:24.199 --> 04:27.899
It was a boarding school for difficult children.

30
04:28.600 --> 04:30.800
At least that's what the ad said.

31
04:31.500 --> 04:33.100
Pond Bottom

32
04:33.500 --> 04:36.399
The school seemed to be named just for me.

33
04:36.899 --> 04:38.199
Good morning.

34
04:40.199 --> 04:42.199
You are alone?

35
04:43.000 --> 04:44.600
What are you doing here?

36
04:45.399 --> 04:47.699
I'm waiting for Saturday.

37
04:48.000 --> 04:49.600
Why?

38
04:50.199 --> 04:52.399
Because my father will come and fetch me.

39
04:52.800 --> 04:55.199
But today is not Saturday.

40
04:56.199 --> 04:58.300
Pepinot!

41
04:58.399 --> 05:02.300
I'm Clement Mathieu, the new prefect.

42
05:04.699 --> 05:06.399
Is this your first prefect position?

43
05:06.500 --> 05:08.100
I once taught in a private school.

44
05:08.399 --> 05:10.399
-What did you teach?
-Music.

45
05:10.600 --> 05:12.600
-You will get on well with Mr. Rachin

46
05:12.699 --> 05:14.800
The Headmaster. He used to play the trumpet.

47
05:15.000 --> 05:16.399
Really?

48
05:16.800 --> 05:19.100
These are his daughters, he lives here.

49
05:21.399 --> 05:25.800
-Have you met him before?
-Not yet, I got the job through Mme Boissement.

50
05:26.000 --> 05:27.100
Really?

51
05:27.500 --> 05:29.600
That was Uncle Maxence

52
05:29.699 --> 05:31.899
He proceeded to explain that he was in charge of...

53
05:32.000 --> 05:35.899
security, first aid,
store room, and window repair.

54
05:37.899 --> 05:39.300
What is he doing?

55
05:39.899 --> 05:41.600
Student punished by Mr Rachin.

56
05:42.300 --> 05:45.300
15 days of community service... Maid work

57
05:45.500 --> 05:47.199
What are the kids like?

58
05:47.399 --> 05:48.899
Didn't they tell you?

59
05:49.100 --> 05:50.000
No.

60
05:51.399 --> 05:54.300
This is the infirmary.
Later I will show you my little vegetable patch.

61
05:54.500 --> 05:55.699
With pleasure.

62
05:58.699 --> 06:01.500
-What have they done this time?
-Let's me help you...

63
06:01.699 --> 06:03.500
Are you Clement Mathieu?

64
06:03.600 --> 06:05.399
The Headmaster.

65
06:05.500 --> 06:07.300
Rachin, Headmaster.

66
06:07.899 --> 06:09.800
Ah, Headmaster, I am sorry.

67
06:10.000 --> 06:11.199
Yes, you are late.

68
06:11.300 --> 06:14.500
-I was given the wrong bus timetable.
-Keeping on time is a basic principle here.

69
06:14.800 --> 06:16.100
Very well.

70
06:16.199 --> 06:17.600
Headmaster.

71
06:18.199 --> 06:19.899
Very well, headmaster.

72
06:20.000 --> 06:21.100
Ok, follow me.

73
06:22.100 --> 06:27.100
I first suggest you learn our regulations.
You will supervise study after 4pm.

74
06:31.500 --> 06:33.500
What's the matter! Answer!

75
06:33.899 --> 06:35.600
-Take this

76
06:35.800 --> 06:38.300
Another trap.
Our pupils' lovely disposition.

77
06:38.399 --> 06:40.399
Let's sit him down there.

78
06:40.899 --> 06:41.899
I can't see.

79
06:42.699 --> 06:45.300
Don't overdo it, let me take a look.

80
06:45.500 --> 06:47.000
Not so good.

81
06:47.300 --> 06:51.100
-You, go ring the bell, call everyone.
-Shouldn't we call a doctor first?

82
06:51.300 --> 06:54.500
You know how much they cost?
What did I tell you, go ring the bell.

83
06:55.000 --> 06:56.100
Where is the bell?

84
06:56.300 --> 06:58.899
Open the door, you'll see it.

85
07:01.899 --> 07:04.699
Everyone here!

86
07:04.701 --> 07:07.500
Everyone here!

87
07:08.300 --> 07:10.000
Does this kind of incident often happen?

88
07:10.000 --> 07:12.199
Ring, just ring the bell.

89
07:26.199 --> 07:28.800
Everyone in the yard!

90
07:34.800 --> 07:37.699
Quickly, keep quiet.

91
07:37.899 --> 07:40.600
- Egg head!
- Quiet!

92
07:40.600 --> 07:43.300
-Bullet head!
-Quiet!

93
07:44.600 --> 07:45.699
Keep quiet.

94
07:45.800 --> 07:48.000
-I didn't say anything!
-Quiet!

95
07:54.699 --> 08:00.699
I've called you out because Uncle Maxence
has just been wounded in a cowardly attack.

96
08:00.699 --> 08:04.399
According to our action-reactionprinciple,
the one responsible shall be severely punished.

97
08:05.100 --> 08:08.600
If the guilty one does not turn himself in
within 3 seconds,

98
08:08.899 --> 08:13.550
You will all take turns in jail, 6 hours each.

99
08:13.550 --> 08:18.199
Until he turns himself in or is denounced.

100
08:18.800 --> 08:22.500
One two three

101
08:23.500 --> 08:26.899
No one? Naturally.

102
08:26.901 --> 08:28.550
Come here.

103
08:28.550 --> 08:30.199
You, Mathieu

104
08:30.201 --> 08:30.999
Me?

105
08:31.000 --> 08:32.699
Come here.

106
08:32.700 --> 08:36.499
Mr. Chabert, give me the record book, thank you

107
08:36.500 --> 08:39.500
Mr. Mathieu, the new prefect,
is fortunate not to know you yet.

108
08:39.600 --> 08:41.100
Egg head!

109
08:41.100 --> 08:42.597
Be quiet.

110
08:42.600 --> 08:46.600
He will therefore decide impartially
who will be punished first.

111
08:49.600 --> 08:51.649
Be quiet!

112
08:51.651 --> 08:53.923
Pick a name.

113
08:53.924 --> 08:55.663
At random?

114
08:55.663 --> 08:57.399
If I may...

115
08:57.399 --> 08:59.798
Leave him. Go ahead

116
09:02.798 --> 09:04.700
Boniface

117
09:05.700 --> 09:09.399
Unlucky. Chabert, bring Boniface out.

118
09:09.399 --> 09:12.399
But, I didn't do anything!

119
09:12.399 --> 09:13.197
Shut up!

120
09:13.200 --> 09:16.000
It's unfair!
Shut your mouth! Let's go.

121
09:16.899 --> 09:18.298
I won't go!
I'll kick your ass if I have to!

122
09:18.301 --> 09:20.399
Quiet!

123
09:21.100 --> 09:24.899
In addition, as long as the criminal is at large,
recess is canceled,

124
09:25.100 --> 09:27.298
And visits are forbidden.

125
09:27.298 --> 09:29.798
I invite you to denounce him as fast as possible.

126
09:29.801 --> 09:32.499
This only encourages denouncing.

127
09:32.500 --> 09:36.750
Like all new-comers, you have generous illusions.
Let's talk again in a week.

128
09:36.750 --> 09:41.000
Until then have Mr Regent show you your quarters.
You're taking over from him.

129
09:44.899 --> 09:46.700
Clean sheets.

130
09:46.701 --> 09:48.200
Thanks.

131
09:50.399 --> 09:51.798
Why are you leaving?

132
09:53.500 --> 09:55.850
10 stitches

133
09:55.850 --> 09:58.197
Scissors.

134
09:58.200 --> 10:01.298
All this because I confiscated Mouton's cigarettes.

135
10:01.301 --> 10:02.197
Mouton?

136
10:02.200 --> 10:06.399
A kid. His name is Mouton.

137
10:06.399 --> 10:10.599
Is he still here, this Mouton?

138
10:10.600 --> 10:14.200
For your info, Le Querrec is the one who set the trap
on Maxence's door.

139
10:14.298 --> 10:16.298
I overheard him talking about it.

140
10:16.399 --> 10:17.500
Why did you keep silent?

141
10:17.600 --> 10:19.899
I don't want to miss the bus.

142
10:20.100 --> 10:22.600
Maxence punished him for breaking some window panes.

143
10:22.700 --> 10:26.100
It's a revenge. Just his style.

144
10:26.200 --> 10:30.700
Le Querrec, you have remember this name.

145
10:30.899 --> 10:33.798
And Morange, yes, Morange

146
10:33.899 --> 10:36.100
He speaks little, but you have to keep an eye on him.

147
10:36.200 --> 10:38.500
Angel face, but possessed by the devil.

148
10:38.600 --> 10:41.500
Action/reaction, that's all they understand.

149
10:46.000 --> 10:50.700
I'm leaving. Good luck!

150
10:50.701 --> 10:52.200
Thank you.

151
10:59.000 --> 11:00.798
Our benefactor.

152
11:00.899 --> 11:02.899
This is the class schedule.

153
11:03.000 --> 11:07.100
Classes were split between the headmaster,
doing history and French,

154
11:07.298 --> 11:10.899
while the rest was taught by a certain
Mr Langlois.

155
11:11.100 --> 11:13.500
Mr. Langlois, let me introduce our new prefect.

156
11:13.700 --> 11:14.798
My name is Clement Mathieu

157
11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
A prefect at your age?

158
11:16.700 --> 11:18.899
Yes, I was once a teacher.

159
11:19.100 --> 11:21.500
That is perfect.

160
11:24.700 --> 11:26.899
He's the funniest of the lot.

161
11:27.000 --> 11:29.100
Go to the study room now - You are late.

162
11:29.298 --> 11:31.298
No need to show you the way...

163
12:03.298 --> 12:04.899
Gentlemen.

164
12:09.899 --> 12:15.100
Smoking is forbidden in class, everyone, even you, sir.

165
12:21.200 --> 12:24.298
Give it back to me, quiet!

166
12:28.298 --> 12:31.100
Give it back to me.

167
12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
Good start!

168
12:34.700 --> 12:36.500
Congratulations. Mathieu

169
12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
Be seated.

170
12:40.200 --> 12:44.100
Naturally. You, always you.

171
12:45.200 --> 12:47.100
What did he do?

172
12:47.200 --> 12:49.700
Nothing. Headmaster

173
12:49.899 --> 12:51.700
What do you mean, nothing.

174
12:51.798 --> 12:53.298
Didn't you want to punish him just now?

175
12:53.399 --> 12:57.899
I was asking him to the blackboard,
and requesting silence when you came in.

176
12:58.100 --> 13:03.500
Indeed you needed silence.
Don't let me have to come back.

177
13:09.600 --> 13:11.899
Go to the corner.

178
13:13.298 --> 13:18.500
All right. Now that you know me better,
we need to set a few things straight.

179
13:20.500 --> 13:22.899
Right now, one of your fellow pupils is in jail.

180
13:23.000 --> 13:24.700
For nothing.

181
13:24.899 --> 13:28.500
I may not look smart,
but I was not born yesterday.

182
13:28.600 --> 13:30.500
I know who did it.

183
13:30.600 --> 13:33.700
I give him 15 seconds to confess.

184
13:36.700 --> 13:38.500
I am waiting.

185
13:40.700 --> 13:43.100
Too bad. Only 5 seconds left.

186
13:45.200 --> 13:46.899
Too late.

187
13:48.000 --> 13:51.600
Le Querrec, who is Le Querrec

188
13:52.600 --> 13:54.000
Me, sir

189
13:55.700 --> 13:57.798
What a coincidence.

190
13:58.000 --> 13:59.899
So, it is you who wounded Mr. Maxence.

191
14:00.000 --> 14:01.197
No. not me.

192
14:01.200 --> 14:03.100
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

193
14:03.100 --> 14:03.999
I did nothing.

194
14:04.000 --> 14:07.700
Who do you think the headmaster will believe,
you or me?

195
14:08.000 --> 14:12.100
While I am out, I would like someone serious
to watch over the class.

196
14:12.399 --> 14:16.000
If I believe my trusted intuition,

197
14:16.200 --> 14:17.600
this serious person is Mr Morange.

198
14:19.600 --> 14:22.500
Be quiet, who is Morange?

199
14:23.899 --> 14:25.798
Me, sir.

200
14:32.399 --> 14:34.798
So, you are the angel face

201
14:35.798 --> 14:38.700
Go to the blackboard.
You watch the class while I am out.

202
14:39.500 --> 14:40.798
Let's go!

203
14:41.798 --> 14:43.399
Nice attire.

204
14:43.399 --> 14:45.798
Pull your shirt out further,
it's more proper.

205
14:46.100 --> 14:49.700
Black sheep are said to have authority over their peers.
Prove it to me.

206
14:50.798 --> 14:53.298
Let's go. To the headmaster.

207
14:56.000 --> 14:57.399
Have mercy, sir.

208
14:57.399 --> 14:58.298
Mercy?

209
14:58.298 --> 15:00.200
Did you show mercy on the classmate
who is in jail instead of you?

210
15:00.298 --> 15:01.999
How about Uncle Maxence?

211
15:02.000 --> 15:04.298
I didn't want to harm him. It was just a joke.

212
15:04.301 --> 15:06.000
A joke?

213
15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
It's enough. Do you hear,
You'll get a good beating in my office.

214
15:17.500 --> 15:18.399
Who is that?

215
15:18.399 --> 15:21.500
It's Leclerc, he ran away for the third time.

216
15:22.500 --> 15:23.899
He will be sent to jail.

217
15:23.899 --> 15:25.798
This way you'll have a companion. Let's go.

218
15:25.899 --> 15:27.399
No.

219
15:29.399 --> 15:32.600
Listen. Maybe we can make a deal.

220
15:32.798 --> 15:35.100
You wounded uncle Maxence badly. Really bad.

221
15:35.298 --> 15:38.798
I will not bring you to the headmaster,
but I'll punish you.

222
15:39.298 --> 15:43.700
From now on, during recess,
you'll work in the infirmary.

223
15:43.899 --> 15:48.500
You will look after Uncle Maxence,
until he is recovered.

224
15:49.500 --> 15:50.899
Do you agree?

225
16:08.899 --> 16:11.100
Not bad, ah?

226
16:12.500 --> 16:15.600
I believe I can do better. Show me your profile.

227
16:16.298 --> 16:18.200
Profile.

228
16:31.100 --> 16:33.399
I give you a little smile for a change.

229
16:33.798 --> 16:36.000
There you go. Have a look.

230
16:36.200 --> 16:38.399
Ah, I forget.

231
16:38.500 --> 16:40.298
A little spot of colour.

232
16:43.298 --> 16:45.899
Does it look better? Go back to you seat.

233
16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
All right, in order to know you better,

234
16:49.700 --> 16:56.000
Please write down your name, age and what you want to do
when you grow up.

235
17:03.298 --> 17:05.099
To my surprise,

236
17:05.099 --> 17:07.099
all the pupils did as they were asked.

237
17:11.099 --> 17:13.000
Everybody, expect one.

238
17:17.400 --> 17:19.099
Aren't you writing?

239
17:21.599 --> 17:23.099
How long have you been here?

240
17:24.798 --> 17:26.900
A long time?

241
17:27.099 --> 17:28.798
I don't know.

242
17:30.798 --> 17:32.900
Come on, write, little boy.

243
17:48.298 --> 17:50.298
An exhausting first day.

244
17:50.400 --> 17:52.500
I don't know why I am here.

245
17:53.500 --> 17:55.798
Rachin scares me. This place scares me.

246
17:55.900 --> 17:58.200
Even the kids scare me.

247
17:58.298 --> 18:01.900
I feel they may run into my room at any time
and do me in.

248
18:01.901 --> 18:03.200
My blanket.

249
18:05.200 --> 18:09.098
Give me a puff.
Shut up. Go to sleep.

250
18:23.598 --> 18:26.098
I read what the pupils wrote.

251
18:26.700 --> 18:29.000
They were all dreaming of fabulous carreers.

252
18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
Two firemen, three cowboys, one tiger-tamer,
one fighter pilot

253
18:32.298 --> 18:34.900
two spies, a general under Napoleon.

254
18:35.000 --> 18:40.298
one hot air balloon pilot, three soldiers.
No prefect.

255
18:42.000 --> 18:44.700
It's very kind to volunteer to take care of me.

256
18:45.700 --> 18:49.798
See, doctor, the new prefect asked for a volunteer.

257
18:50.000 --> 18:53.298
And he responded. Spontaneously.

258
18:54.098 --> 18:56.200
This shows miracles do happen.

259
18:56.201 --> 18:58.798
Please come in.

260
18:58.798 --> 19:00.700
This is Mr. Mathieu, our new prefect.

261
19:01.299 --> 19:02.299
How are you
How are you

262
19:02.402 --> 19:03.201
How is he?

263
19:03.500 --> 19:09.598
It's quite a bad gash.
If now they come after you, hope is lost.

264
19:10.400 --> 19:12.798
You have such infinite patience towards them.

265
19:13.298 --> 19:14.499
I'm hard headed.

266
19:14.500 --> 19:18.098
The poor kids have it way worse than me here.

267
19:18.298 --> 19:20.000
One of them died here.

268
19:20.000 --> 19:21.199
One died?

269
19:21.200 --> 19:24.400
His name was Mouton.
Jumped from the rooftop.

270
19:24.500 --> 19:26.199
Fortunately, he was an orphan.

271
19:26.200 --> 19:29.400
Like him, everyone says nothing can be done.
But that's not true.

272
19:29.500 --> 19:32.700
He's a good boy.
You just need to know him.

273
19:32.900 --> 19:35.798
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?

274
19:36.098 --> 19:38.298
Le Querrec, I am talking to you.

275
19:38.400 --> 19:40.798
Uncle Maxence is kind, isn't he?

276
19:43.098 --> 19:44.098
Yes.

277
19:44.200 --> 19:45.098
I can't hear you.

278
19:45.200 --> 19:48.798
Leave him alone. He is shy, just like me.

279
19:58.500 --> 19:59.499
Yes?

280
19:59.500 --> 20:00.598
I need to talk to you. Headmaster.

281
20:00.798 --> 20:04.200
You already want to leave?
No, I just want to do an experiment.

282
20:06.400 --> 20:08.900
About uncle Maxence's accident.

283
20:09.098 --> 20:10.400
That was no accident.

284
20:10.500 --> 20:13.298
Sure. I would like you to grant me three things.

285
20:13.400 --> 20:14.598
What?

286
20:14.700 --> 20:16.500
First, lift the collective punishment.

287
20:16.598 --> 20:18.900
Second, allow me to punish the guilty one.

288
20:19.000 --> 20:21.900
Third, please allow me to keep his name to myself.

289
20:22.400 --> 20:23.999
Provided you have the name.

290
20:24.000 --> 20:26.098
Of course, only provided I have it.

291
20:26.200 --> 20:27.999
You are arrogant, man.

292
20:28.000 --> 20:30.298
So, you believe you can find him just like that.

293
20:30.400 --> 20:33.598
Alright. If you succeed,
I'll lift the punishment.

294
20:33.700 --> 20:36.798
You'll never find the guilty party,
or I am the king of imbeciles.

295
20:38.598 --> 20:41.200
I know who did it, sir.

296
20:43.200 --> 20:47.000
Is that so. Who is it?

297
20:47.798 --> 20:50.000
You allowed me to keep his name a secret.

298
20:51.000 --> 20:53.900
Good, very good.

299
20:54.098 --> 20:55.500
But your methods irritate me.

300
20:55.798 --> 20:58.298
Don't let me find anything wrong with your class.

301
20:58.598 --> 21:00.598
I feel I already have them well under control.

302
21:00.700 --> 21:03.400
You speak too soon.

303
21:20.598 --> 21:22.597
These are not naughty pictures.

304
21:22.598 --> 21:24.400
I never said they were naughty pictures.

305
21:24.401 --> 21:26.298
What's written on yours?

306
21:26.400 --> 21:30.098
Ave Maria, Soprano, by Clement Mathieu

307
21:30.298 --> 21:35.200
Mine says cord quatuor, by Clement Mathieu

308
21:35.500 --> 21:36.900
This looks like music sheets.

309
21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
How do you know?

310
21:38.098 --> 21:39.098
Maybe it's morse code?

311
21:39.101 --> 21:40.450
Secret codes?

312
21:40.451 --> 21:41.798
Maybe he's a spy.

313
21:41.798 --> 21:43.500
Yes, possibly a spy disguised as a prefect.

314
21:43.598 --> 21:45.700
Quick! Egghead is coming.

315
21:55.700 --> 21:57.400
Give it back to me.

316
21:57.401 --> 21:59.098
What is it, sir.

317
21:59.200 --> 22:00.400
None of your business.

318
22:00.598 --> 22:03.000
Any problem, Mathieu?

319
22:04.200 --> 22:06.000
No, nothing.

320
22:06.200 --> 22:07.700
These are music sheets.

321
22:07.798 --> 22:09.900
What for?

322
22:10.298 --> 22:12.000
A choir

323
22:12.500 --> 22:15.400
In the toilet...

324
22:15.401 --> 22:18.298
Choir, out you go.

325
22:23.400 --> 22:25.798
None of this here, Mathieu
None of what?

326
22:26.098 --> 22:27.598
Don't pretend you don't know what
I am talking about.

327
22:27.601 --> 22:29.098
Certainly you don't believe...

328
22:29.101 --> 22:30.598
I'll close one eye this time.

329
22:31.598 --> 22:34.500
You really see evil everywhere.
Here? Yes.

330
22:53.298 --> 22:55.699
Bullet head you're finished.

331
22:56.298 --> 22:58.500
You won't make the rules here.

332
22:59.500 --> 23:02.500
You won't make the rules here.

333
23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
You won't make the rules here.

334
23:07.500 --> 23:09.598
You won't make the rules here.

335
23:09.900 --> 23:11.900
Hey, guys, are you chicken or what?

336
23:13.900 --> 23:15.298
Your name is Corbin, right?

337
23:15.400 --> 23:16.500
Sir, I did nothing.

338
23:16.598 --> 23:17.700
Yes, you are singing.

339
23:17.798 --> 23:18.798
Sir, I swear.

340
23:18.798 --> 23:21.000
You are singing, besides, off-key.

341
23:21.098 --> 23:22.798
You don't even know.

342
23:22.798 --> 23:26.500
Come on, sing again, I am listening.

343
23:26.900 --> 23:29.000
Maybe you want to sing in the principal's office.

344
23:29.200 --> 23:32.200
Come on, sing: Bullet head you're finished.

345
23:32.700 --> 23:35.098
Bullet head you're finished.

346
23:35.500 --> 23:37.798
You won't make the rules here.

347
23:37.900 --> 23:40.000
You won't make the rules here.

348
23:40.098 --> 23:42.798
No one ever told you that you sing really bad...

349
23:43.000 --> 23:45.798
Is it true you have music in your briefcase, sir?

350
23:45.900 --> 23:48.900
Mind your own business.

351
23:49.298 --> 23:51.200
Which reminds me.

352
23:51.298 --> 23:56.798
The next one I catch going through my things,
it will cost him dearly.

353
23:57.098 --> 24:01.000
Now, silence.
Go to sleep. Finished.

354
24:15.900 --> 24:17.598
Sleep.

355
24:35.598 --> 24:38.298
I have this tune stuck in my head.

356
24:38.500 --> 24:41.298
They don't sing very well, but they sing.

357
24:42.298 --> 24:45.200
I even spotted a few good voices.

358
24:45.700 --> 24:47.598
Is there really nothing we can do with these kids?

359
24:48.798 --> 24:51.400
Me who swore never to touch my music sheets again.

360
24:53.400 --> 24:55.798
Never say never.

361
24:56.400 --> 24:59.000
There's always something to try.

362
25:07.000 --> 25:09.798
January 23, one week after the accident.

363
25:10.000 --> 25:12.400
uncle Maxence's takes a turn for the worse.

364
25:12.798 --> 25:15.298
The doctor has him sent to the hospital.

365
25:20.098 --> 25:21.298
Will he die?

366
25:23.798 --> 25:25.900
No, they will save him.

367
25:27.900 --> 25:30.298
That same day, Pepinot got in trouble.

368
25:30.500 --> 25:33.598
Mr. Pepinot, you are hopeless.

369
25:33.601 --> 25:35.798
Last question, last one

370
25:36.798 --> 25:40.000
How did Marshall Ney die?

371
25:47.000 --> 25:48.700
I am waiting.

372
25:58.700 --> 26:00.400
Hunting?

373
26:02.400 --> 26:03.798
Zero.

374
26:03.798 --> 26:06.798
You'll write a 100 times for tomorrow:
Marshall Ney was executed.

375
26:07.798 --> 26:09.200
Dismissed

376
26:16.900 --> 26:18.298
Boniface

377
26:18.298 --> 26:20.500
Come here boy.

378
26:20.500 --> 26:22.798
Boniface

379
26:22.798 --> 26:25.200
Here. It's a reward for your composition

380
26:25.400 --> 26:27.798
You take this to madam Marie, she will give you a biscuit.

381
26:27.900 --> 26:30.200
You did know that Marshall Ney was shot?

382
26:30.400 --> 26:32.900
Yes, sir, just like Napoleon.

383
26:34.400 --> 26:36.500
Get out.

384
26:36.700 --> 26:38.400
Wait, Mr. Morange

385
26:39.400 --> 26:41.500
I saw you taking notes during my class.

386
26:41.700 --> 26:44.098
I must say such studiousness surprises me.

387
26:44.700 --> 26:46.598
Bring me your notebook.

388
27:01.000 --> 27:02.400
Charming.

389
27:07.400 --> 27:11.400
There. Read it. Admire the spelling.

390
27:15.900 --> 27:19.000
Mr. Rachin eats shit by the crate.

391
27:19.798 --> 27:21.598
Did he write 'Mr.'?

392
27:22.298 --> 27:23.598
Err, no

393
27:23.700 --> 27:27.500
Mr. Mathieu, action and reaction, put him in jail.

394
27:32.598 --> 27:34.200
Let's go

395
27:56.200 --> 27:58.500
Gentlemen, good appetite.

396
27:59.900 --> 28:01.700
Are you hungry Pepinot?

397
28:07.200 --> 28:09.500
There, you can eat now.

398
28:09.900 --> 28:12.000
Pepinot is an orphan.

399
28:12.900 --> 28:15.000
His parents died during the war.

400
28:15.298 --> 28:17.200
How did they die?
Don't know.

401
28:17.500 --> 28:20.598
The kid got it in his head that
his father will come pick him up on Saturday.

402
28:21.700 --> 28:23.700
Every Saturday, nobody comes.

403
28:24.000 --> 28:27.200
We tell him it's for next week, and so on.

404
28:27.400 --> 28:29.000
Wouldn't it be better to tell him the truth?

405
28:29.098 --> 28:32.900
We told him a 100 times that his dad and mum are both dead.
Nothing doing.

406
28:33.098 --> 28:37.098
Now, we let him wait by the gate,
it makes him happy.

407
28:38.598 --> 28:39.798
Be quiet.

408
28:41.798 --> 28:44.400
You see? Action and reaction.

409
28:45.400 --> 28:46.500
What do you mean?

410
28:46.598 --> 28:49.400
Action? Reaction!

411
28:49.598 --> 28:52.200
Someone is asking for the Morange boy.

412
28:52.298 --> 28:53.798
Morange? He is in jail.

413
28:53.900 --> 28:56.598
No visit for the punished ones. You know the rules

414
28:56.798 --> 28:58.900
You go tell the visitor yourself.

415
29:24.400 --> 29:25.700
How are you, madam.

416
29:25.798 --> 29:27.098
How are you.

417
29:27.200 --> 29:29.000
I am the new prefect.

418
29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I am Pierre Morange's mother.

419
29:32.200 --> 29:33.500
Clement Mathieu

420
29:33.700 --> 29:37.500
I know it's not visiting day today,
but it's the only free time...

421
29:37.798 --> 29:39.699
That's not it...

422
29:39.700 --> 29:41.400
He is punished again?

423
29:41.500 --> 29:43.200
No, no, he is not punished.

424
29:43.500 --> 29:45.400
But he is not here.

425
29:45.700 --> 29:47.000
Why?

426
29:48.000 --> 29:51.400
He was sent to the dentist an hour ago.
Tooth ache.

427
29:51.798 --> 29:52.900
Tooth ache.

428
29:53.000 --> 29:55.298
Yes tooth ache. But nothing serious.

429
29:55.500 --> 29:57.400
He will be back in the evening.

430
29:57.798 --> 30:01.500
I can't wait. My shift starts at 5pm.

431
30:01.798 --> 30:04.000
Can I pass you something for him?

432
30:04.700 --> 30:06.200
Of course.

433
30:09.200 --> 30:12.500
Her name is Violette, Violette Morange

434
30:12.798 --> 30:15.700
Single mother. Despairing over her son's attitude.

435
30:15.798 --> 30:20.500
Prone to stealing, introvert.
Expelled from a few schools for running away.

436
30:21.000 --> 30:24.400
When Pierre was sent to Pond Bottom
against his mother's will,

437
30:24.500 --> 30:29.700
She told the judge: at least,
he'll have two warm meals a day.

438
30:31.900 --> 30:33.798
Jan. 30, the experiment begins.

439
30:34.000 --> 30:36.598
They wear round hats, long live the Bretons

440
30:37.598 --> 30:40.500
They wear round hats, long live Britanny

441
30:40.700 --> 30:44.200
They wear round hats, long live the Bretons

442
30:44.400 --> 30:47.000
Soprano - Left side.

443
30:47.200 --> 30:48.598
Leclerc

444
30:50.700 --> 30:55.798
God's child is born, Let's all sing his coming.

445
30:56.000 --> 30:58.200
Almost in tune.
Alto, stand left.

446
30:58.700 --> 31:00.000
Delaire

447
31:02.700 --> 31:05.700
Three kilometers on foot,
it's tough, it's tough

448
31:05.900 --> 31:08.900
Three kilometers on foot,
it's tough on the shoes.

449
31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Sing from the beginning.

450
31:10.400 --> 31:13.098
Four kilometers on foot,
it's tough, it's tough

451
31:13.400 --> 31:15.900
Four kilometers on foot,
it's tough on the shoes.

452
31:16.098 --> 31:18.798
Like I thought, Bass, right.

453
31:19.098 --> 31:20.400
Ricoeur

454
31:24.798 --> 31:26.598
There's good tobacco in my snuffbox

455
31:26.798 --> 31:29.000
There's good tobacco, but you won't get any.

456
31:29.400 --> 31:30.598
Smoking is not allowed.

457
31:30.601 --> 31:32.798
Alto, left

458
31:32.900 --> 31:34.400
Ilouse

459
31:37.400 --> 31:40.000
Love is like a Bohemian child,

460
31:40.298 --> 31:42.598
It has never ever known any laws.

461
31:43.298 --> 31:46.400
Tenor, of course. stand left.

462
31:46.798 --> 31:48.298
Pepinot

463
31:52.298 --> 31:54.098
I don't know any song .

464
31:54.598 --> 31:56.700
Never mind, I'll teach you.

465
31:58.298 --> 32:03.200
In the mean time, I nominate you
Choir assistant director.

466
32:08.200 --> 32:09.598
Boniface

467
32:12.598 --> 32:14.900
Marshall, here we are!

468
32:15.900 --> 32:17.200
Who taught you this song?

469
32:17.298 --> 32:18.798
My grandfather.

470
32:19.000 --> 32:21.298
A bit out of fashion. Go left.

471
32:22.298 --> 32:23.700
Clement

472
32:25.700 --> 32:29.200
Take arms, citizens. Form your battalions.

473
32:29.400 --> 32:30.897
Right

474
32:30.900 --> 32:35.500
Prefects are the worst kind,
Smoking, drinking, never working.

475
32:35.700 --> 32:36.598
Left

476
32:36.700 --> 32:39.298
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo

477
32:39.400 --> 32:42.598
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo

478
32:43.000 --> 32:45.400
Very well, alto

479
33:12.098 --> 33:13.798
Show me, Corbin?

480
33:20.298 --> 33:23.500
Sorry, this note does not exist. Come here

481
33:24.500 --> 33:27.400
Mr. Pepinot, give me the music score.

482
33:27.900 --> 33:29.098
Thank you very much.

483
33:29.101 --> 33:30.000
Open your hands

484
33:30.098 --> 33:32.400
Present them like this.

485
33:32.798 --> 33:34.900
I nominate you music stand.

486
33:36.598 --> 33:40.098
Mr. Pepinot, baton, thanks a lot.

487
33:42.900 --> 33:44.798
Attention. Follow me.

488
33:57.500 --> 33:58.848
There you have it!

489
33:58.851 --> 34:00.199
One two three four

490
34:00.200 --> 34:02.200
The headmaster eats stale bread.

491
34:02.400 --> 34:04.098
Lerlec is not very smart

492
34:04.298 --> 34:07.700
Every night, I make them practice a simple tune
I compose.

493
34:09.099 --> 34:12.599
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is rather disconcerting

494
34:12.699 --> 34:16.300
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is what is bothering us

495
34:16.699 --> 34:20.699
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is rather disconcerting

496
34:20.701 --> 34:24.699
We are from Pond Bottom.
That is what is bothering us.

497
34:26.199 --> 34:27.400
Not bad.

498
34:27.500 --> 34:30.199
It was rather basic, but I had their attention.

499
34:30.400 --> 34:33.500
To move things along, I needed support
from my hierarchy.

500
34:34.099 --> 34:35.300
What?

501
34:36.400 --> 34:37.699
A choir?

502
34:38.699 --> 34:40.000
Yes

503
34:40.300 --> 34:43.199
Poor Mathieu, you have gone off your rocker.

504
34:43.400 --> 34:47.099
A choir? They will never sing a note,
or I am the king of...

505
34:47.199 --> 34:49.599
Please sir. Do not tell me king of what.

506
34:49.800 --> 34:51.099
Why?

507
34:51.800 --> 34:53.699
Because they are already singing.

508
34:54.099 --> 34:56.300
Really?
A little.

509
34:56.500 --> 34:59.000
So why do you come ask me for an authorisation
since you've already gone ahead.

510
35:00.000 --> 35:01.900
I don't like your methods, you hear me?

511
35:02.000 --> 35:02.898
Sir

512
35:02.900 --> 35:04.400
You are bothering me.

513
35:04.500 --> 35:06.300
I have other problems to deal with.

514
35:06.400 --> 35:11.000
All right. I too want to have a laugh.
Make them sing.

515
35:11.699 --> 35:15.199
But if things go wrong, you'll lose your job.
Go

516
35:18.199 --> 35:21.800
Thank you for your kind words of encouragement, sir.

517
35:25.800 --> 35:29.699
Feb. 8, first rehearsals.
Rachin is relentless on Morange

518
35:30.300 --> 35:35.199
After jail, he makes an example out of him:
one month of community service.

519
35:58.699 --> 36:00.599
Hey, maid, don't forget to make my bed!

520
36:35.300 --> 36:36.599
Feb. 15

521
36:36.699 --> 36:39.400
A visit from Dr. Dervaux. He is a psychologist

522
36:39.699 --> 36:42.099
He brought us a little present.

523
36:42.099 --> 36:46.000
We decided to bring this boy from St Fereol's juvenile detention centre.

524
36:46.199 --> 36:51.199
To study his capacity to adapt to a more liberal environment.

525
36:52.000 --> 36:55.900
Unlike most of his classmates,
Mondain is starting to read and write.

526
36:56.099 --> 36:57.800
In any case, he can talk

527
36:58.000 --> 36:59.400
More or less normally.

528
36:59.599 --> 37:02.699
We submitted his intellect
to the Binet-Simon test

529
37:02.900 --> 37:04.498
Ah, the Binet-Simon test!

530
37:04.500 --> 37:07.400
We also gave him Rorchar's test

531
37:07.599 --> 37:08.797
Good.

532
37:08.800 --> 37:12.300
The test, as you know,
divides children's intelligent into 7 categories.

533
37:12.400 --> 37:17.199
Normal, adequate, borderline,
Slightly retarded, medium, severely retarded

534
37:17.500 --> 37:20.400
And finally, imbeciles

535
37:20.599 --> 37:23.199
Mondain is in the borderline zone.

536
37:23.199 --> 37:27.099
He is therefore not demented. I must however warn you.

537
37:28.099 --> 37:31.800
He exhibit gregarious-instinct pervert tendencies.

538
37:33.900 --> 37:35.500
Bad enough.

539
37:35.699 --> 37:37.400
What exactly does that mean?

540
37:37.500 --> 37:40.599
Doctor?

541
37:40.800 --> 37:45.800
Prone to cruelty, parasitism and destruction. Above all,

542
37:46.000 --> 37:48.300
Mythomania
There you have it.

543
37:48.500 --> 37:49.998
We already have lots like that here.

544
37:50.000 --> 37:53.199
Except here kids have access to maistream teaching.

545
37:53.400 --> 37:57.000
It will be interesting to see how Mondain
can integrate

546
37:57.500 --> 37:58.699
Least we can do.

547
37:58.900 --> 38:02.300
We will all try to meet your scientific expectations.

548
38:02.500 --> 38:04.400
Gentlemen, kindly take charge of this boy.

549
38:04.599 --> 38:06.599
May I keep you for lunch?
With pleasure.

550
38:06.800 --> 38:09.000
As for him, give him all the necessary attention.

551
38:09.199 --> 38:11.599
Action and reaction.

552
38:19.900 --> 38:21.699
No smoking here.

553
38:21.900 --> 38:25.500
To start the experiment on a good footing,
I first have to establish my authority.

554
38:31.199 --> 38:33.699
You really look like a jerk.

555
38:35.099 --> 38:37.800
You better lie low, or there will be trouble.

556
38:38.800 --> 38:40.400
Ok.

557
38:45.400 --> 38:47.300
There will be trouble.

558
38:52.300 --> 38:54.199
Surely you know at least one song?

559
38:55.599 --> 38:57.500
Yes, but...

560
38:57.699 --> 38:58.900
But what?

561
38:59.099 --> 39:00.900
You will not like it.

562
39:02.099 --> 39:04.900
Let's have it. Come on.

563
39:05.099 --> 39:06.300
Come on

564
39:12.000 --> 39:13.800
I am listening.

565
39:14.199 --> 39:16.500
(Dirty song)

566
39:19.300 --> 39:20.800
Stop

567
39:20.800 --> 39:22.300
enough.

568
39:23.400 --> 39:25.500
I told you.

569
39:26.300 --> 39:29.900
Not bad, needs practice.
But you have quite a good baritone voice.

570
39:30.400 --> 39:31.500
What voice?

571
39:31.699 --> 39:35.800
baritone, it is not an insult.
Describes singers with a deep voice.

572
39:36.800 --> 39:39.000
Go to the back, with the basses.

573
39:41.000 --> 39:41.898
Bitch.

574
39:41.900 --> 39:44.099
Let the bitch rest.

575
39:44.300 --> 39:45.900
The next one who laughs gets my fist in his face.

576
39:46.000 --> 39:48.099
Whenever you wish, Mondain

577
39:51.199 --> 39:53.199
Isolation over

578
39:53.699 --> 39:56.500
I brought Pepinot back. You forgot him by the gate.

579
39:56.699 --> 39:59.699
Pepinot, it's not Saturday today.

580
40:01.699 --> 40:04.900
By the way, in the letters to your parents

581
40:05.099 --> 40:06.800
I don't have any parents.

582
40:07.400 --> 40:09.199
Of course, to those who have parents

583
40:09.300 --> 40:12.900
Remind them that they can visit you on
the first or third Thursday of the month.

584
40:13.000 --> 40:17.400
Morange, you are already distracted.
What did I just say?

585
40:17.699 --> 40:18.699
I don't know.

586
40:19.000 --> 40:20.699
I just said, you can write to your mother

587
40:20.800 --> 40:23.300
To visit you on the first or third Thursday every month.

588
40:24.300 --> 40:26.800
Or on both days, got it?

589
40:26.900 --> 40:30.099
But punished pupils cannot get visits so be careful.
I don't feel like seeing my parents.

590
40:30.800 --> 40:32.400
But Morange may want to see his mother.

591
40:32.400 --> 40:34.300
Maybe he's not the only one.

592
40:37.099 --> 40:39.599
See, Morange, we have a real choir now.

593
40:39.800 --> 40:41.099
I don't care.

594
40:41.199 --> 40:42.699
What do you mean you don't care?

595
40:42.800 --> 40:44.199
What kind of voice do you have? Do a scale.

596
40:44.300 --> 40:46.800
Do... Come on.

597
40:47.800 --> 40:50.000
Do you want to go back to jail? Come on, quick.

598
40:56.000 --> 40:58.500
Rudeness does not look good on you, my boy.

599
40:58.699 --> 41:01.400
Not everyone can be like Mondain.

600
41:01.400 --> 41:02.900
Let's start again.

601
41:05.699 --> 41:06.599
Where are you going?

602
41:06.699 --> 41:09.900
I've had enough, I am going to the toilet.
Mondain, wait.

603
41:10.599 --> 41:13.300
Come,Corbin
Can I also go to the toilet,sir?

604
41:14.300 --> 41:16.199
All right, everybody out.

605
41:26.599 --> 41:29.199
Quiet, quiet

606
41:49.599 --> 41:51.500
You sing well, pretty girl.

607
41:55.300 --> 41:56.500
You want some?

608
41:57.599 --> 42:01.500
They left you all alone? I will protect you.

609
42:03.500 --> 42:06.199
Wait for me. We are alike.

610
42:06.699 --> 42:08.900
My parents are assholes.

611
42:09.900 --> 42:11.900
Your mother is the same way.

612
42:12.300 --> 42:14.500
She leaves you here to have peace.

613
42:14.800 --> 42:16.300
No, she has to work

614
42:16.400 --> 42:19.300
-Ah, so what the others say is true.
-What?

615
42:19.800 --> 42:21.800
She is a whore

616
42:26.800 --> 42:28.500
Get in!

617
42:30.500 --> 42:32.199
You're a dead man!

618
42:32.900 --> 42:34.699
Am I?

619
42:44.699 --> 42:47.300
That day, Morange was missing at the
3pm roll call.

620
43:25.300 --> 43:28.300
No one ever knew where he went,
but he came back.

621
43:29.300 --> 43:31.199
That's what mattered.

622
43:33.300 --> 43:34.900
Why are you here?

623
43:40.900 --> 43:42.599
I'm not allowed to go upstairs

624
43:43.599 --> 43:45.400
What do you mean?

625
43:46.800 --> 43:48.000
Why?

626
43:49.000 --> 43:50.199
Because I have no money

627
43:50.900 --> 43:53.699
You have no money, so you can't sleep?
What is this all about?

628
43:54.699 --> 43:59.300
It's Mondain.
If I don't give him money, he won't let me upstairs.

629
44:04.699 --> 44:05.800
We must be careful

630
44:10.000 --> 44:11.900
Where I was before I was
caught by the prefect.

631
44:12.300 --> 44:14.099
So I had to let him have it.

632
44:14.800 --> 44:16.199
How?

633
44:16.199 --> 44:19.300
Stabbed him with a bayonet. He bled well.

634
44:19.400 --> 44:21.800
-Did you kill him?
-You bet

635
44:21.900 --> 44:24.800
It's the same here.
Egg head better leave me alone.

636
44:25.099 --> 44:26.300
Mathieu is not the worst.

637
44:26.400 --> 44:28.800
Are you kidding?
Singing you a lullaby,

638
44:29.099 --> 44:33.000
Then when you sleep he will come and touch you.
This type must all be killed.

639
44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
Good evening, gentlemen

640
44:40.900 --> 44:43.000
-Have a good appetite!
-I swear I didn't do anything, sir!

641
44:43.699 --> 44:46.300
I see you have high-class friends, Corbin

642
44:48.300 --> 44:49.500
Get out!

643
44:57.199 --> 45:00.199
This feast I just witnessed will be our secret.

644
45:00.400 --> 45:01.599
Gift to you.

645
45:01.699 --> 45:03.099
But I warn you,

646
45:03.500 --> 45:07.300
Don't speak to Pepinot, don't approach him

647
45:07.699 --> 45:10.599
Don't even look at him, is that clear?

648
45:12.400 --> 45:17.099
A single look towards him and I'll turn
your life into a nightmare

649
45:52.900 --> 45:55.599
-What are you doing here, Morange?
-Nothing, sir

650
45:56.500 --> 46:00.199
I must have heard voices - I must be tired.

651
46:02.199 --> 46:06.599
Article 8 of school regulations:
students are not allowed into classrooms alone

652
46:07.000 --> 46:09.699
If it were Mr. Rachin, you would have to
write it a 100 times for tomorrow.

653
46:09.900 --> 46:11.699
Plus what he would tell your mother.

654
46:12.699 --> 46:14.500
I don't care about my mother

655
46:15.099 --> 46:17.000
-What did she do, tell me!
-I have nothing to tell you

656
46:17.199 --> 46:19.400
Wait! I'm not finished.
You won't get off that easily.

657
46:19.599 --> 46:22.400
Nothing is free here, ask Pepinot

658
46:23.800 --> 46:27.000
Your problem, Morange, is
that you do things that are unlike you.

659
46:27.099 --> 46:29.550
Run away, get into fights, play truant

660
46:29.550 --> 46:32.000
It may amuse the others, but not me.

661
46:32.500 --> 46:37.800
I won't play your little game.
From tomorrow, compulsory choir practice.

662
46:37.900 --> 46:40.000
And daily music class.

663
46:40.099 --> 46:41.699
Go, go to sleep

664
46:42.500 --> 46:43.599
Go

665
46:45.400 --> 46:46.699
March 3

666
46:46.800 --> 46:49.099
He cannot know, but I am sure of it.

667
46:49.300 --> 46:50.900
His voice is a miracle

668
46:51.099 --> 46:53.400
The rare promise of an exceptional musical gift.

669
46:53.599 --> 46:56.099
You can go now, keep quiet

670
46:58.099 --> 46:59.900
Keep quiet!

671
47:00.300 --> 47:02.800
Gradually, as my choir gets better

672
47:03.500 --> 47:05.300
I domesticate my new student.

673
48:26.099 --> 48:28.099
Ok, take your calculus notebooks

674
48:32.199 --> 48:35.400
You are the one who makes the children sing?

675
48:35.599 --> 48:38.000
Yes, isr
Are you complaining?

676
48:38.099 --> 48:41.000
Oh, no, on the contrary
I love music,

677
48:41.199 --> 48:44.199
-I sometimes myself croon
-Do you?

678
48:54.500 --> 48:55.998
Have a nice day!

679
48:56.000 --> 48:59.099
Same to you, my dear colleague

680
48:59.101 --> 49:01.900
Algebra book, page 27

681
49:34.900 --> 49:36.400
Hello, madam

682
49:37.900 --> 49:39.300
Pierre will come soon

683
49:39.400 --> 49:41.900
-What happened?
-Everything is fine

684
49:42.400 --> 49:44.000
How about his tooth?

685
49:44.199 --> 49:45.500
It got better

686
49:45.599 --> 49:48.099
Did you tell him I dropped by?

687
49:48.500 --> 49:51.300
-No
-Why?

688
49:51.500 --> 49:53.297
I preferred not to tell him.

689
49:53.300 --> 49:57.300
As you know, Pierre is a sensitive child,
and talented.

690
49:57.599 --> 49:59.599
a talent for mischief.

691
49:59.699 --> 50:01.599
Not only that,

692
50:01.800 --> 50:05.500
I must talk to you about it

693
50:05.800 --> 50:07.599
Singing? Nobody taught him?

694
50:07.800 --> 50:11.300
He has a gift. It's obvious.
Something must be done.

695
50:13.000 --> 50:14.500
Hello

696
50:15.500 --> 50:17.000
I'll leave the two of you.

697
50:17.599 --> 50:19.300
Don't hesitate to come and see me.

698
50:22.300 --> 50:26.900
I didn't tell your mother you were punished,
I told here you were at the dentist. No betrayal.

699
50:49.900 --> 50:52.300
-I'm told that you sing well?
-Yes

700
50:56.300 --> 51:00.500
The gentleman seems happy with you, is he kind to you?

701
51:01.500 --> 51:02.900
Not bad

702
51:06.099 --> 51:10.699
I brought you clean clothes,
and I made your favourite chocolate cake.

703
51:12.800 --> 51:14.099
Are you happy?

704
51:23.099 --> 51:26.199
April, the children inspire me.

705
51:26.400 --> 51:29.599
I knew the day would come when
my music would be played.

706
51:29.800 --> 51:35.400
I'm Clement Mathieu, musician,
every night, I compose for them.

707
53:19.099 --> 53:20.800
It was not good, sir?

708
53:20.900 --> 53:23.800
Yes, good, it was very good.

709
53:27.400 --> 53:29.599
You bastard! Go!

710
53:30.599 --> 53:32.000
What did he do?

711
53:32.099 --> 53:34.199
He stole my watch.
Caught him in my bedroom.

712
53:34.800 --> 53:37.000
Bringing him to see Rachin. Action-Reaction

713
53:37.500 --> 53:39.599
-Where are you taking him?
-Jail! 15 days!

714
53:40.599 --> 53:43.099
-Wait!
-Wait for what?

715
53:43.400 --> 53:45.500
He is my only barytone

716
53:49.500 --> 53:50.800
Mathieu!

717
53:51.000 --> 53:53.199
-What's the matter, sir?
-I found graffiti in the...

718
53:57.199 --> 54:00.000
Sorry, sir, just a loose shot

719
54:02.000 --> 54:03.400
Stand aside!

720
54:04.599 --> 54:06.300
Mathieu, Chabert,

721
54:09.300 --> 54:11.199
With me

722
54:13.199 --> 54:16.900
As the weeks pass, I score
new victories.

723
54:27.900 --> 54:29.800
Leclerc, we are still good friends, ain't we?

724
54:30.199 --> 54:31.699
Of course, why do you ask this?

725
54:31.900 --> 54:33.900
-5 plus 3?
-53

726
54:34.099 --> 54:35.800
-Are you sure?
-Of course

727
54:35.900 --> 54:36.699
Thanks!

728
54:56.699 --> 54:58.099
Maybe it's only an illusion, but

729
54:58.199 --> 55:01.599
It seems that even our headmaster is changing

730
55:47.900 --> 55:50.699
Look, Uncle Maxence

731
55:59.699 --> 56:02.699
Attention, don't move

732
56:02.900 --> 56:04.300
Smile

733
56:10.300 --> 56:13.500
Come on, come out, Mondain!

734
56:22.500 --> 56:25.099
It's finished, child

735
56:33.099 --> 56:35.199
Come on!

736
56:41.199 --> 56:43.300
Chabert, I just met Mr Rachin

737
56:43.400 --> 56:46.800
To tell him that Mathieu's choir is fantastic

738
56:47.300 --> 56:49.300
-I'm tired
-But you are alawys so tired, alright 29!

739
56:49.500 --> 56:50.900
And what was his answer?

740
56:51.099 --> 56:53.300
Get the hell out is what he told me.

741
56:54.099 --> 56:56.300
Where is Mondain?

742
56:58.300 --> 57:00.400
Didn't you notice he was missing before the run?

743
57:00.500 --> 57:02.199
He was at roll call this morning, Headmaster

744
57:02.300 --> 57:03.699
After that, he...

745
57:03.800 --> 57:06.000
Good, in this case, I forbid
all outside walks until the end of the year.

746
57:06.001 --> 57:08.800
-Did he take much money?
-All the money, around 200 thousands francs

747
57:08.900 --> 57:12.300
How do I pay suppliers now? How?

748
57:12.599 --> 57:14.099
I should never have accepted him in here.

749
57:14.199 --> 57:16.300
All this for a damn experiment!

750
57:16.500 --> 57:19.199
Just like you, with your music

751
57:22.199 --> 57:27.000
I needed coal delivered for hot water, it will be next week.
I call the police.

752
57:31.699 --> 57:32.800
What's the matter?

753
57:48.599 --> 57:50.300
I observe that singing makes them smarter, Mathieu

754
57:50.400 --> 57:52.000
They make great progress

755
57:52.099 --> 57:54.699
Headmaster, children have had
no warm water for three weeks

756
57:54.800 --> 57:57.400
Cold water is good for blood circulation.

757
57:59.800 --> 58:01.400
By the way, Mathieu

758
58:01.500 --> 58:03.300
No more choir.

759
58:04.699 --> 58:07.500
-But, Headmaster
-Thanks, Mr. Mathieu

760
58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Police station, please

761
58:18.000 --> 58:19.699
I don't know yet about the choir

762
58:19.900 --> 58:22.099
But for the kids, we can use wood.

763
58:22.300 --> 58:24.300
We have no firewood at all!

764
58:29.500 --> 58:32.900
Headmaster's personal storage

765
58:34.400 --> 58:36.599
Chabert,Action-Reaction

766
58:36.800 --> 58:38.099
Chabert surprised me

767
58:38.199 --> 58:40.300
I thought he was Rachin's clone

768
58:40.400 --> 58:46.599
He actually is a nice man, who believes sports and music
are the cements of our society.

769
58:48.699 --> 58:51.800
With his help, I organize resistance

770
58:52.099 --> 58:54.199
Our choir becomes a clandestine affair.

771
59:16.900 --> 59:19.900
No, you always let up at the end of the sentence

772
59:20.900 --> 59:24.000
I'm asking one last time to detach
every note clearly.

773
59:24.500 --> 59:26.599
It's late, we'll work on this tomorrow

774
59:26.699 --> 59:28.500
We are not doing the second part, sir?

775
59:28.699 --> 59:30.099
I didn't teach you the solo part

776
59:30.300 --> 59:31.900
But I learnt it.

777
59:32.099 --> 59:34.199
You did?

778
59:35.201 --> 59:38.201
Ok, let's begin

779
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.300
Come on, come out

780
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:26.400
May 13th, 3pm, Mondain is back

781
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.400
-Where is the money?
-I don't know

782
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.199
-Who stole it?
-I don't know, not me

783
01:00:47.199 --> 01:00:48.800
What's happening?

784
01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:50.400
He is beating him?

785
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.800
For half an hour

786
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.199
Is he mad?

787
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.300
He is wasting his time, the child
won't say anything at all

788
01:00:58.699 --> 01:01:02.400
Ok, let's start from the beginning

789
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.800
Where is the money?

790
01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.500
Tell me!

791
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.400
Where is the money?

792
01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:15.900
Let go!

793
01:01:16.599 --> 01:01:18.300
Let go!

794
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.500
Calm down!

795
01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:24.400
Calm down!

796
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.500
The child has just confessed,
I'll call back the police.

797
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.400
You will get to know another residence, with
other wardens and bars.

798
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.599
To avoid depressing the children,
we did not tell them about the Mondain affair.

799
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.000
We told them he was sent back to his original school.
End of story.

800
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
A hen

801
01:02:07.199 --> 01:02:10.099
Lays 84 eggs

802
01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:15.000
every year

803
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.099
Well fed, with good housing,

804
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.400
Ventilation and sanitation,

805
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.400
It will lay 150 eggs

806
01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:38.500
How many more eggs can a farm girl obtain

807
01:02:39.099 --> 01:02:44.800
if she owns 9 hens?

808
01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:00.699
Nice day?

809
01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:04.900
It's good to have a bit of sun.

810
01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.300
Summer days are coming.

811
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.400
You know, Pierre surprises me everyday a bit more

812
01:03:13.199 --> 01:03:14.400
Anyway, I..

813
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500
I wanted to thank you for what you do for him.

814
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.199
I do it for you as well

815
01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.199
I mean, if Pierre is good,
so will you be...

816
01:03:26.599 --> 01:03:29.699
-Let me wipe it
-It's ok, it's ok

817
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.599
-Just ink, nevermind
-You are too much! Idiot!

818
01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:38.500
What's the matter? Oh!

819
01:03:39.099 --> 01:03:41.199
Why do you beat him?

820
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.599
Tell me, Bebert

821
01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.199
Because he threw ink at you

822
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Can't you shut up?

823
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.400
Pierre, I'm ashamed of you.

824
01:03:54.699 --> 01:03:59.199
Wait! It's ok!

825
01:04:00.199 --> 01:04:02.599
You have to understand,
It's because he is proud of you and you are pretty

826
01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.000
Pretty?

827
01:04:04.099 --> 01:04:07.000
I mean, you are unusual comparing with
other children's mother

828
01:04:07.199 --> 01:04:09.000
Do you mean that I'm alone?

829
01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:10.900
Me too.

830
01:04:11.099 --> 01:04:13.199
-But you have no children
-No

831
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.199
I have sixty

832
01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:18.400
But when they see you, they see the
lady of their dreams

833
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.599
I mean, the mother they all dreamt about

834
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.500
It's not a dream for Pierre, you are his mother

835
01:04:24.699 --> 01:04:27.199
Like all other children,
he doesn't want to share with others

836
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.500
We must get him out of this boarding school where he's
wasting his time and send him to music school.

837
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.599
I'd like him to have a real job.

838
01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:35.398
Music is a true career

839
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.699
Provided one has solid grounding.
He could go to Lyons Institute of Music,

840
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.900
I'd keep an eye on him so he does not stray.

841
01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:44.500
Even there, you can get a bad teacher

842
01:04:44.699 --> 01:04:49.800
-And then?
-Then, he will become whatever he must.

843
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.099
Alone we can't do anything.

844
01:04:52.199 --> 01:04:55.000
Pierre is an exception. I will do everything in my power
so that his talent can bloom.

845
01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:59.699
- But it need your help, too
- I see, thanks

846
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.900
No, no! What's the matter, today? Are you all sleepy?

847
01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:30.000
And you, Boniface, how do you stand?

848
01:05:30.099 --> 01:05:32.500
Do you think we can sing like this?
Stand straight!

849
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.400
Ok, again, start from So gentle...

850
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.699
Where is my solo?

851
01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:12.900
What solo?

852
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.199
My solo!

853
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.599
Ah, yes, your solo, no, no solo any more

854
01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.099
You have a decent voice,
but no one is indispensible.

855
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.099
You sing or not. It does not matter to me.

856
01:06:21.199 --> 01:06:23.900
We can do without you. Listen.

857
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.699
Listen, we start...

858
01:06:29.699 --> 01:06:31.500
We start from Oh, night

859
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.599
Mathieu!

860
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.099
-You're gonna get a scolding...
-I thought he had gone to town?

861
01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.800
Dismissed. Go play outside.

862
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.199
You are a pain, do you know that?

863
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.000
Headmaster, I promise you,
homework is finished

864
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.500
Our charity committee heard of your choir

865
01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.297
The countess herself writes to me

866
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.199
She and her friends are visiting next sunday
They want to listen

867
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.599
It's great!

868
01:07:22.699 --> 01:07:24.099
I mean, it's good

869
01:07:24.199 --> 01:07:28.699
I already see the scene. Simpering,
music, why not petit fours since we're at it!

870
01:07:28.701 --> 01:07:31.900
You give me extra work with all these silly
things of yours!

871
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.900
But, Headmaster, you will notice

872
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.800
that Music has not relaxed discipline.

873
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.500
We have had less problems for quite some time.

874
01:07:38.599 --> 01:07:39.498
Coincidence

875
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.199
I don't believe in coincidences, Headmaster

876
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.199
It looks that way. Who apart from you
would tell the foundation about the choir?

877
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.500
It's me

878
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.797
Do you know how to write?

879
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.000
-Uncle Maxence probably thought he was doing a good thing.
-Spare me your explanations

880
01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:55.800
I don't like your ways, Mathieu

881
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I think you don't like much, Headmaster

882
01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.500
Mr. Rachin, someone for you
in the guest room!

883
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.099
Let's talk about this later

884
01:08:07.699 --> 01:08:09.199
It's for you

885
01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:13.400
Sometimes I think we should have let
Mondain strangle him.

886
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.898
Violette was thanking me for what I was doing for her son.

887
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.600
She wanted to talk to me about it privately

888
01:08:21.699 --> 01:08:24.100
And tell me something important.

889
01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:28.000
Rendez-vous at Square Cafe, 20th, 4pm

890
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.898
I wrote a letter to the Lyons Institute of Music

891
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.500
I know the principal there

892
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.199
He kindly answered

893
01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.800
he would be glad to audition your son,
and in case he is admitted,

894
01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.599
He would help him get a scolarship.

895
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.800
-Things will be easier on that front from now on.
-Is that so?

896
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.000
After I met you,

897
01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.300
My...my life...

898
01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.800
How to say?

899
01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.300
-Change totally?
-Exactly!

900
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.100
It's all thanks to you

901
01:09:02.398 --> 01:09:03.699
I could not imagine...

902
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.300
Same here. I had lost hope...

903
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.800
I'm thinking, maybe I'm wrong to go too fast.

904
01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:13.398
Ah, no, trust me, no problem

905
01:09:14.398 --> 01:09:16.500
It's true that you brought me luck.

906
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.398
Luck?

907
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.398
I met someone,

908
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.100
He is an eningeer from Lyons

909
01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.800
I met him at the cafe.

910
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.500
He works around here on a bridge project.

911
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.398
Are you ok?

912
01:09:42.398 --> 01:09:43.398
Fine

913
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.600
It's a great opportunity, for you and Pierre.

914
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500
Don't get upset. I have to run.

915
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.300
I'm love for the three of us to have
lunch together one of these days.

916
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.398
You will tell him about Pierre? Please?

917
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.100
Why not

918
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.000
Ok, goodbye

919
01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:06.699
Goodbye

920
01:10:10.699 --> 01:10:12.898
Thanks for all you've done

921
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.398
Oh, not a word to Pierre for the time being.

922
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.800
Sorry, may I take the chair?

923
01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:37.699
-Of course
-Thanks

924
01:11:59.699 --> 01:12:02.199
Countess, I... glad... flowers.

925
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.699
I did not catch everything,
but I get the intention.

926
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.199
Thank you, my child

927
01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.500
Countess, please allow me to introduce you to Mr. Mathieu,

928
01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:14.699
Our prefect, who makes our dear children sing.

929
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.398
Countess

930
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.100
Please accept my compliments, sir,

931
01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:22.398
We follow with great interest the humane and sensitive
teaching methods of Mr Rachin.

932
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.000
We thank you for your contribution
to these methods.

933
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.300
By the way, who came up with the idea for the choir?...

934
01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.398
-Well...
-Mine, Countess, my idea

935
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.000
It is a great pleasure, Countess, to help
such an understanding director.

936
01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:39.600
Alright. Make them sing.

937
01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:45.500
-Mr. Rachin is modest, he doesn't like praise
-That's right

938
01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.300
What will you sing, then?

939
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.199
La Nuit, by Rameau, Countess

940
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.600
That must be beautiful

941
01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.300
Excuse me, who is the boy standing aside?

942
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.000
Is he being punished?

943
01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:06.100
That boy? He is an exception

944
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.398
May I begin?

945
01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.399
And in the eyes of Morange,
who was following my rythm so well,

946
01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:45.601
I read many things. Pride,
happiness to be forgiven

947
01:15:45.603 --> 01:15:50.603
but also something new for him,
gratefulness.

948
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.300
First day of summer

949
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.300
Our choir welcomes a new member

950
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.898
Sorry, I missed the link. My mistake.

951
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.199
Go ahead.

952
01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.300
Come here, it's important

953
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.800
I was scrubbing the toilet walls to
remove graffitis.

954
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.699
I lifted a tile and found this

955
01:17:09.699 --> 01:17:11.898
-It's Corbin's harmonica
-And this

956
01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.398
At least 200 thousands francs inside

957
01:17:23.398 --> 01:17:25.500
No one knew where your cache was.

958
01:17:26.898 --> 01:17:29.398
Don't tell me you don't know how
the money got there.

959
01:17:30.398 --> 01:17:32.898
Do you know Mondain was expelled
because he was accused of the theft?

960
01:17:33.699 --> 01:17:35.699
I didn't know

961
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.699
It's true - You did not know.

962
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.600
Now I've told you

963
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.898
What got into you?
What were you gonna do with the money?

964
01:17:43.898 --> 01:17:46.398
If I tell you, you won't repeat?

965
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.199
No

966
01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:49.800
I swear

967
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.000
I wanted to buy...

968
01:17:54.199 --> 01:17:56.199
Buy what?

969
01:17:56.398 --> 01:17:58.600
A hot air balloon

970
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.500
We don't know who stole the money,
but it proves that Mondain is innocent

971
01:18:02.699 --> 01:18:04.898
He would never have left without the money.
That's obvious.

972
01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.898
We will look into it in 2 days time, after I come back.

973
01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:09.500
Mathieu, don't worry too much.

974
01:18:09.699 --> 01:18:11.699
If Mondain is not guilty this time, he would
have been another time anyway.

975
01:18:11.898 --> 01:18:13.800
Nothing can be done for such people, nothing.

976
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.800
-How about justice?
-He's in the hands of justice now.

977
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.500
Headmaster, wait for me!

978
01:18:18.699 --> 01:18:20.800
-Wait for me!
-Are you leaving too?

979
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.398
I am catching a ride.
I am spending my vacation at my sister's.

980
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:29.000
There is a piano there

981
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.100
Do you know why Rachin goes to Lyons?

982
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.300
I think he needs to discuss the budget with the committee.

983
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.398
-Doesn't he?
-Yes

984
01:18:46.398 --> 01:18:50.300
But actually, his main purpose is to kiss ass
for promotion and a medal.

985
01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.898
Do you think he will succeed?

986
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:57.300
Crafty as he is?
He will present an idyllic picture of the school,

987
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:03.398
Hide the terrible things you know,
and take credit for the choir's success.

988
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.600
-Success?
-I've heard it, it's very good.

989
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.199
Sir, is it true Langlois and the principal
left together?

990
01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:15.199
Yes, Chabert and Carpentier took two weeks,
We are masters of the place.

991
01:19:15.398 --> 01:19:17.398
Then there is no course today?

992
01:19:18.398 --> 01:19:19.500
No

993
01:19:19.699 --> 01:19:22.500
-What shall we do?
-Take a nap

994
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
No, I have a better idea

995
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.500
Excuse me, you...

996
01:19:33.699 --> 01:19:36.898
-Your medal?
-Yes

997
01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.000
The bird is in the nest, Mr. Rachin

998
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.100
I don't know how to thank you

999
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.898
Headmaster, call for you...

1000
01:19:54.898 --> 01:19:56.600
Excuse me, I...

1001
01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:20.100
The fire started from the roof.

1002
01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:24.699
The blaze was eating up the sleeping quarters,
where the kids were last seen.

1003
01:20:24.898 --> 01:20:28.300
Sixty children killed, trapped like rats.

1004
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.500
To Rachin

1005
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.398
His promotion and medal are going up in flames
right in front of him.

1006
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.398
But suddenly...

1007
01:21:23.398 --> 01:21:26.100
After lunch, we got out by the back door
near the vegetable garden.

1008
01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.000
So that Mary and the villagers would not see us, then

1009
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.199
We went to the Lignon forest

1010
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.199
Why did you go there?

1011
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.898
We did an orientation game.
The kids loved it.

1012
01:21:40.699 --> 01:21:43.500
Suffice to say, uncle Maxence,
I'm extremely disappointed by your behaviour.

1013
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.600
Headmaster, I assume the entire responsibility for this escapade.

1014
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.398
Uncle Maxence never stopped trying to talk me out of it.

1015
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.600
That's what I call a lack of conviction.

1016
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.300
On the other hand, one could say we saved the children's lives.

1017
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.699
Well, if you had not left the school unattended,
there would have been no fire!

1018
01:22:00.199 --> 01:22:03.398
I don't know why I'm still listening to you.

1019
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.800
Ok, uncle Maxence, considering your seniority,

1020
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.398
you will only suffer a suspension.

1021
01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:10.898
As for you, Mr. Mathieu, you are fired

1022
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.898
for breaking the school rules.

1023
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.300
If that's what you want, then fire me too!

1024
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.100
It's not for you to decide.

1025
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.898
Mr. Maxence, thanks for your kindness
But I believe children need you very much

1026
01:22:21.398 --> 01:22:25.600
Think about the children,
since this gentleman never does.

1027
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.800
This is your due, here you are

1028
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.500
You leave immediately by the 6pm bus.

1029
01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:36.500
-I forbid you to see a single one of you pupils.
-What do you mean?

1030
01:22:36.898 --> 01:22:39.898
Uncle Maxence, make sure of it.

1031
01:22:44.398 --> 01:22:49.600
Headmaster, before we part,
let me tell you what I think of you

1032
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.100
I know, Mathieu

1033
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.600
-You are incompetent, cruel.
-What about them

1034
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800
-They didn't choose to be here
-Neither did I

1035
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I never wanted to be an educator.

1036
01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:01.398
And don't tell me you were dreaming
of burying yourself in this god forsaken place.

1037
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.898
You had other ambitions. Me too.

1038
01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.500
-You should not take out your failure on the children.
-You think I enjoy playing prison warden?

1039
01:23:07.699 --> 01:23:09.297
Someone must do it.

1040
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.199
But go ahead, go to Paris

1041
01:23:11.398 --> 01:23:13.000
Go knock on the minister's door

1042
01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:16.300
Hello! I'm Mathieu, we must use true educators
not half wits.

1043
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.000
Get in, fight, since you have faith!
Mathieu! Saint Mathieu!

1044
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:24.300
You're a failed musician, a prefect

1045
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.600
Just a small prefect,

1046
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.600
What do you do in life, Mr Mathieu? I'm a prefect,
prefect, prefect, prefect, prefect!

1047
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.100
You are a madman

1048
01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.398
I'm so tired, go to hell

1049
01:23:38.898 --> 01:23:41.398
On the contrary, I'm leaving it

1050
01:23:53.398 --> 01:23:58.100
I had hoped some children would brave the interdiction
and come say goodbye, but nothing.

1051
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.199
These children's wisdom resembled indifference.

1052
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.500
And Morange, anyway...

1053
01:24:38.398 --> 01:24:41.398
On the first piece of paper,
I see Boniface exquisite handwriting

1054
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.699
And the one with wrong spelling, should be Pepinot's

1055
01:24:44.898 --> 01:24:48.699
And the one with music notes, that's Morange.

1056
01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:53.000
And this one, that one

1057
01:25:15.398 --> 01:25:17.600
Make them stop!

1058
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.000
-They've locked the door

1059
01:25:23.398 --> 01:25:26.500
At that time, I felt a surge of happiness
and optimism.

1060
01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:29.199
I wanted to tell the whole world.

1061
01:25:29.398 --> 01:25:31.100
But who would have listened?

1062
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.800
No one knows who I am

1063
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.398
The great artist would soon crash back to earth.

1064
01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:43.100
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician,
unemployed prefect

1065
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:49.300
I'm Clement Mathieu, a failed musician,
unemployed prefect

1066
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.300
After that?

1067
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.500
He never got around to writing it.

1068
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.100
But I, I can tell you

1069
01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.398
And Pepinot told me.
The next day, on my road back to school

1070
01:26:20.398 --> 01:26:23.000
My childhood memories came back to me.

1071
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.600
After Mathieu was fired, my mother took me back.

1072
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.898
We went to Lyons, where I was admitted to the Music School.

1073
01:26:31.898 --> 01:26:35.000
Engineer wanted me to be a boarder again,
My mother refused

1074
01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:37.199
And he left us

1075
01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:40.800
Chabert, Langlois and uncle Maxence united

1076
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.300
And denounced Rachin's abusive methods towards the students

1077
01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:47.398
Children were questioned, Rachin fired.

1078
01:26:52.398 --> 01:26:55.898
Clement Mathieu continued to teach music
untill he passed away

1079
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.500
He never tried to be famous

1080
01:26:58.699 --> 01:27:02.199
All he did, he kept to himself.

1081
01:27:02.699 --> 01:27:05.898
To him? No, not entirely

1082
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.500
Mr. Mathieu!

1083
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.000
Wait for me

1084
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.500
Mr. Mathieu!

1085
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.800
Why are you here?

1086
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.600
Could you please take me with you?

1087
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.000
Oh, I can't do that

1088
01:27:32.199 --> 01:27:34.500
You must go back to school,
otherwise you will be punished

1089
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.398
-Please
-Shall we go?

1090
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.100
Be right back

1091
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:41.100
I cannot take you away

1092
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.600
Go back

1093
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.100
Go

1094
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.100
Go

1095
01:28:10.199 --> 01:28:12.699
Pepinot was right to believe in it.

1096
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.699
The day Mathieu was fired was a Saturday

1097
01:29:18.199 --> 01:29:21.199
To Violette

1098
01:29:22.199 --> 01:29:32.199
