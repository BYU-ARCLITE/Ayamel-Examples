Labor Deportation Ministry


2
01:46.877 --> 01:48.468
Eat. You may be next!


3
02:05.930 --> 02:08.524
- Hello, Mr. Batignole.
- Hello, Mr. Ruet.


4
02:24.014 --> 02:26.415
- Who's there?
- Lucien Morel, doctor.


5
02:27.485 --> 02:28.314
Come in.


6
02:30.754 --> 02:31.516
Well?


7
02:31.688 --> 02:32.917
It's under control.


8
02:33.257 --> 02:36.454
I got you a pass.
It'll get you to the free zone.


9
02:36.826 --> 02:40.388
Contact my brother-in-law.
He'll take you to Switzerland.


10
02:40.897 --> 02:43.799
Here are the papers
and baptism certificates.


11
02:44.334 --> 02:45.324
Very good.


12
02:46.569 --> 02:47.730
Thank you.


13
02:57.781 --> 03:02.276
From now on you're not Bernstein,
you're Gerard and Paul Louvier.


14
03:02.853 --> 03:03.478
Why?


15
03:03.820 --> 03:04.810
I already told you.


16
03:08.258 --> 03:09.954
- Say it.
- I'm Paul Louvier.


17
03:10.794 --> 03:12.557
- Now you.
- I'm Gerard Louvier.


18
03:14.598 --> 03:15.223
Shall we go?


19
03:36.486 --> 03:37.977
Sleep well my rabbit stews?


20
03:41.891 --> 03:43.223
My God!


21
03:46.497 --> 03:47.724
All our stuff was stolen!


22
03:48.431 --> 03:49.557
- When?
- Last night!


23
03:49.900 --> 03:50.798
It could only happen to you!


24
03:51.801 --> 03:54.235
- What is it?
- My hams were stolen.


25
04:04.247 --> 04:05.646
I said pack light.


26
04:05.816 --> 04:09.252
- I forgot my violin.
- Stay, I'll get it.


27
04:09.520 --> 04:11.282
Only a kid could fit through!


28
04:11.455 --> 04:12.421
What kid?


29
04:13.324 --> 04:16.451
Look no further,
father-in-law.


30
04:16.627 --> 04:18.254
Wait in the car.


31
04:35.745 --> 04:37.372
You're going on vacation?


32
04:37.548 --> 04:39.242
Yes, I'm going on vacation.


33
04:39.417 --> 04:41.976
Can I have a word with you, doctor?


34
04:42.519 --> 04:45.648
I don't want to keep you.
My future son-in-law...


35
04:46.923 --> 04:49.687
It's about your children...
The oldest one.


36
04:49.860 --> 04:51.588
Now, I'm not accusing him...


37
04:51.762 --> 04:55.492
This morning, I brought
some scraps for my rabbits...


38
04:55.665 --> 04:56.894
I'm sorry, I must go.


39
04:57.067 --> 04:58.592
My ham was stolen last night!


40
04:59.037 --> 05:01.300
He must've heard
about tomorrow's raid...


41
05:01.473 --> 05:03.201
I haven't a clue...


42
05:03.507 --> 05:05.499
I sent Mr. Batignole after him.


43
05:05.944 --> 05:07.240
Alright.


44
05:07.411 --> 05:09.504
It's my pleasure, Commissioner.


45
05:09.781 --> 05:11.213
What's going on?


46
05:12.516 --> 05:14.211
Nothing, my treasure.


47
05:14.786 --> 05:16.583
I'll make some coffee.


48
05:17.422 --> 05:19.720
What would he do with ham?
We don't eat it!


49
05:19.990 --> 05:21.548
He can sell it.


50
05:22.726 --> 05:23.920
What are you implying?


51
05:24.262 --> 05:26.286
You think you're so high and mighty.


52
05:26.464 --> 05:29.399
Since you've been here,
you barely say hello.


53
05:30.035 --> 05:32.333
You're a surgeon,
I'm just a butcher,


54
05:32.504 --> 05:34.199
that's no reason to be snooty!


55
05:34.372 --> 05:36.533
I know I wasn't
born under a lucky star!


56
05:37.442 --> 05:38.204
A yellow one?


57
05:40.579 --> 05:43.377
If people resent you so much,
there's a reason.


58
05:43.648 --> 05:45.478
I saved your daughter's life.


59
05:46.451 --> 05:47.975
You were doing your job...


60
05:48.319 --> 05:50.310
And I paid you for your services.


61
05:53.492 --> 05:55.288
What's your husband doing?


62
05:57.295 --> 06:00.730
I hate to end
this fascinating conversation.


63
06:00.899 --> 06:02.423
Will you open your suitcase?


64
06:02.600 --> 06:03.430
No.


65
06:03.802 --> 06:04.961
I'll call the police!


66
06:05.603 --> 06:08.401
- Kiss your vacation good-bye.
- Wait!


67
06:08.639 --> 06:11.165
Dad! What are you doing?


68
06:11.343 --> 06:13.334
We're finishing up.
Leave us!


69
06:14.012 --> 06:15.980
For God's sake, do as I say!


70
06:17.781 --> 06:18.771
Come in.


71
06:26.690 --> 06:27.749
Here.


72
06:32.863 --> 06:33.887
Shit!


73
06:44.942 --> 06:46.740
Here!
And another up there!


74
06:51.815 --> 06:53.579
Run, David! Run!


75
06:53.752 --> 06:55.651
Go. Run.


76
06:56.620 --> 06:58.884
Run away, Simon.
Run away!


77
07:00.324 --> 07:01.791
Let me go!


78
07:03.228 --> 07:04.160
Daddy!


79
07:13.672 --> 07:15.435
On the second floor,
Commissioner.


80
07:31.855 --> 07:33.687
French police!
Open up!


81
07:35.360 --> 07:36.418
Thanks a lot.


82
07:38.663 --> 07:39.629
It wasn't me...


83
07:44.235 --> 07:44.793
Open up!
Police.


84
07:47.404 --> 07:48.963
- Where's the kike?
- Don't know!


85
07:49.307 --> 07:52.208
- What are you doing here?
- He was delaying him.


86
07:56.682 --> 07:57.613
Take them away.


87
08:00.019 --> 08:01.952
Thank you both for your help.


88
08:02.288 --> 08:03.413
I didn't do much.


89
08:03.588 --> 08:06.422
Participating is enough.
Don't you agree?


90
08:06.591 --> 08:08.526
Absolutely.
Thank you again.


91
08:39.258 --> 08:41.692
- Did he pay for the ham?
- No.


92
08:41.927 --> 08:44.588
- You dunce!
- They'll pay when they return.


93
08:44.764 --> 08:46.254
That won't be soon.


94
08:46.432 --> 08:48.923
- Where are they going?
- Compiegne, then Germany.


95
08:49.268 --> 08:51.735
- Their things are up there!
- Not for long.


96
09:01.746 --> 09:04.476
Careful, it's fragile!


97
09:23.635 --> 09:25.399
Where is it all going?


98
09:25.671 --> 09:27.934
It's stored in Paris,
and sent to Germany.


99
09:28.374 --> 09:29.567
And the apartment?


100
09:29.741 --> 09:31.572
An administrator handles it.


101
09:32.945 --> 09:35.846
If you'd like,
we could benefit from this.


102
09:36.448 --> 09:37.813
I can pull some strings.


103
09:40.720 --> 09:41.879
We can't accept.


104
09:42.988 --> 09:44.682
It's 200 square meters...


105
09:45.758 --> 09:47.248
I don't want any trouble.


106
09:49.427 --> 09:52.192
When opportunity knocks,
my husband ignores it.


107
09:52.731 --> 09:55.724
There's money to be made
these days, but no!


108
09:56.769 --> 09:58.395
He's got scruples.


109
09:59.504 --> 10:01.995
"He's Got Scruples"
Great title for a play!


110
10:02.341 --> 10:03.740
Get the first one produced.


111
10:33.706 --> 10:35.503
Sir?


112
10:35.673 --> 10:38.643
It's regarding
the Bernstein apartment.


113
10:40.346 --> 10:41.573
Come in.


114
10:48.354 --> 10:50.254
- We have rice pudding.
- No thanks.


115
10:50.423 --> 10:51.014
As you wish.


116
10:51.356 --> 10:54.884
I started by saying you were
a hardcore anti-Semite...


117
10:55.061 --> 10:58.496
That you thought Germany
and its culture was the future!


118
10:58.664 --> 11:00.326
I'm French nationalist all the way.


119
11:00.500 --> 11:03.491
I didn't stress that.
I spoke of your artistic side...


120
11:03.970 --> 11:06.836
Your articles
against degenerate art.


121
11:07.006 --> 11:09.804
I told him that to write your plays,


122
11:09.975 --> 11:12.706
you needed a calm,
comfortable apartment.


123
11:12.879 --> 11:14.676
- And?
- He's not against it.


124
11:15.381 --> 11:16.508
You're the best!


125
11:17.250 --> 11:18.910
Some "tea" for the digestion?


126
11:20.386 --> 11:21.649
He wants to see you.


127
11:22.022 --> 11:25.389
I hear he's seeing some actress,
she's a call girl...


128
11:25.558 --> 11:28.356
He wants to produce a play for her.


129
11:28.995 --> 11:30.724
And you'll write it.


130
11:31.364 --> 11:34.855
- When can I meet your colonel?
- Tonight.


131
11:35.402 --> 11:36.231
Excuse me.


132
11:36.403 --> 11:38.927
Mr. Guitry, a table will be free
in a few minutes.


133
11:39.940 --> 11:41.407
Sir!
Excuse me, Sir.


134
11:42.408 --> 11:44.000
- Do I know you?
- Pierre-Jean Lamour.


135
11:44.344 --> 11:45.470
I'm sorry...


136
11:45.644 --> 11:47.976
I sent you my play
a month ago.


137
11:49.582 --> 11:51.379
My pen name's Francis Mozeur.


138
11:51.684 --> 11:54.245
Of course, Francis Mozeur...


139
11:54.421 --> 11:56.285
The renowned theater critic.


140
11:56.856 --> 12:00.485
He has a fatal machinegun style,
like his initials.


141
12:01.293 --> 12:01.817
Initials?


142
12:02.328 --> 12:03.557
F.M.


143
12:03.763 --> 12:05.594
In otherwords,
Frankly Mediocre.


144
12:05.966 --> 12:07.899
Your table Mr Guitry.


145
12:08.235 --> 12:10.225
- You're insulting me, Sir!
- Yes.


146
12:10.403 --> 12:13.269
But that's not how
I earn my living.


147
12:19.946 --> 12:21.640
- You know...
- What!


148
12:21.815 --> 12:22.975
Forget it.


149
12:23.316 --> 12:24.681
So, about the colonel...


150
12:34.561 --> 12:35.892
Isn't that nice.


151
12:36.495 --> 12:37.690
It was a gift.


152
12:37.864 --> 12:39.524
Earned through another's loss.


153
12:39.698 --> 12:42.030
The tables are finally turning.


154
12:43.336 --> 12:45.360
I've never denounced anyone.


155
12:45.572 --> 12:47.505
We don't talk politics here.


156
12:47.673 --> 12:49.004
I'm speaking my mind.


157
12:49.341 --> 12:50.740
Be like me.
Don't!


158
12:51.076 --> 12:52.567
Thank you very much.


159
12:54.280 --> 12:55.611
Have a nice day.


160
12:57.817 --> 12:58.976
Good night.


161
12:59.318 --> 13:00.445
See you tomorrow.


162
13:07.860 --> 13:10.523
I'm off to the movies
with Pierre-Jean.


163
13:11.431 --> 13:13.831
- How are you getting there?
- By metro.


164
13:14.000 --> 13:17.298
I'll drop you off.
You can help me with a delivery.


165
13:17.937 --> 13:18.904
Yes, Daddy.


166
13:19.438 --> 13:22.408
- Feeling a bit flat, Paul?
- Very funny.


167
13:22.576 --> 13:25.203
- What's playing?
- "The Killer lives at nï¿½ 21."


168
13:25.378 --> 13:28.471
There's a party
at Colonel Spreich's afterwards.


169
13:28.748 --> 13:29.407
Spreich?


170
13:29.582 --> 13:32.017
The one who seized
the Jews' furniture.


171
13:32.351 --> 13:33.979
You're invited?
Nice one.


172
13:34.321 --> 13:36.948
Pierre-Jean's cousin knows him.


173
13:37.289 --> 13:39.280
I don't like this, Micheline.


174
13:39.458 --> 13:41.255
I'm just having some fun.


175
13:42.028 --> 13:44.758
- Your fiancï¿½, isn't.
- Who cares about him.


176
13:45.966 --> 13:46.727
So drop him.


177
13:46.899 --> 13:49.265
He's moves
in all the right circles.


178
13:49.436 --> 13:52.461
- All the doors open for him.
- Doors can shut too.


179
13:53.441 --> 13:55.966
The Germans are here.
You should benefit from it.


180
13:56.309 --> 13:59.609
I may be an old fool,
but I fought the Germans...


181
13:59.779 --> 14:02.248
I've got a painful memento
in my thigh...


182
14:02.416 --> 14:04.907
I won't kiss up to the Germans.


183
14:06.721 --> 14:08.916
What about the apartment?


184
14:09.255 --> 14:10.688
I don't want it.


185
14:10.857 --> 14:12.188
Don't bother peddling!


186
14:14.695 --> 14:17.721
We lived like sardines
in 20 square meters.


187
14:17.898 --> 14:20.457
While they lived
in the lap of luxury.


188
14:21.402 --> 14:24.269
It's on the upper floor, too.


189
14:24.605 --> 14:26.299
It's perfect for you.


190
14:26.474 --> 14:28.202
Think of the grandchildren...


191
14:28.375 --> 14:31.640
They'd have to marry.
I wouldn't hold my breath.


192
14:31.812 --> 14:34.871
- They're engaged 2 years already.
- She's using him.


193
14:36.417 --> 14:39.817
What about our customers?
People are talking.


194
14:39.986 --> 14:41.783
People always have to eat.


195
14:41.956 --> 14:45.687
Dealing with the Krauts
won't change the line at the door.


196
14:45.993 --> 14:47.893
Use your brain...


197
14:48.062 --> 14:50.292
If you still have one.


198
14:55.802 --> 14:57.498
Look, my little sausage!


199
14:59.874 --> 15:02.638
This place is a dream.


200
15:03.277 --> 15:04.538
Don't dream. It's not ours.


201
15:05.245 --> 15:07.270
It's not our home,
and it's too big!


202
15:56.397 --> 15:58.990
Where did they go?


203
15:59.567 --> 16:00.726
Gone!


204
16:00.900 --> 16:02.960
They disappeared,
like the French army.


205
16:03.571 --> 16:04.434
Applause!


206
16:06.639 --> 16:08.301
This is Paris!


207
16:13.847 --> 16:16.339
Here's the young author
I told you about.


208
16:16.517 --> 16:18.883
Please, don't get up.


209
16:19.486 --> 16:23.253
I hear you're
a budding young talent.


210
16:23.423 --> 16:24.947
And my faith is intact, too.


211
16:25.292 --> 16:27.522
My latest play.
I autographed it.


212
16:27.695 --> 16:29.663
"A New Order." I know this play.


213
16:29.964 --> 16:30.931
You're in it.


214
16:31.631 --> 16:32.996
Do I come off as a buffoon?


215
16:33.333 --> 16:36.928
It shows your nation
as the leader of a New Order...


216
16:37.772 --> 16:39.865
The future... The great Europe!


217
16:40.341 --> 16:41.932
You should change the title.


218
16:42.275 --> 16:43.833
I told you it wasn't a good title!


219
16:44.577 --> 16:46.568
It's only a temporary title.


220
16:46.746 --> 16:49.442
Everything's temporary,
right Mademoiselle?


221
16:50.985 --> 16:51.610
Answer him.


222
16:52.553 --> 16:53.986
What about our other business?


223
16:55.389 --> 16:58.222
Yes, come to my office tomorrow.


224
16:58.393 --> 17:00.258
- Yes, Colonel.
- 10 sharp.


225
17:00.427 --> 17:00.894
Great title!


226
17:02.264 --> 17:05.528
"10 Sharp."
I can see the first scene...


227
17:05.700 --> 17:07.599
How about a little spin,
Mademoiselle?


228
17:15.376 --> 17:17.606
- Is he after Micheline?
- Forget it.


229
17:17.778 --> 17:20.770
He likes the way you criticize
the Jews.


230
17:20.949 --> 17:22.677
I've been writing plays
forten years.


231
17:22.951 --> 17:25.418
He wants you to take
a more active stand.


232
17:25.586 --> 17:29.421
In return, Batignole
gets the apartment.


233
17:29.758 --> 17:31.554
200 square meters
is worth the effort.


234
17:31.726 --> 17:32.351
Hold on.


235
17:32.527 --> 17:34.961
If I were you,
I wouldn't hesitate long.


236
17:35.462 --> 17:38.523
I know Spreich.
Like milk, he sours quickly.


237
17:51.846 --> 17:53.007
Need my glasses?


238
17:53.347 --> 17:55.407
Colonel Spreich will see you.


239
17:57.751 --> 17:59.845
Edmond, the little gift.


240
18:00.588 --> 18:01.452
Of course.


241
18:03.325 --> 18:06.259
I won't offend you
by counting it now.


242
18:14.869 --> 18:17.895
You now live in 200 square meters.


243
18:18.306 --> 18:19.534
Thank you, Colonel.


244
18:19.708 --> 18:22.336
Thank your future
son-in-law, Madam.


245
18:22.509 --> 18:24.500
He's a remarkable
young man.


246
18:24.679 --> 18:26.270
He's a lovely young man.


247
18:26.448 --> 18:28.608
I was told by my administrator


248
18:28.782 --> 18:31.808
you're the best caterer in Paris.


249
18:34.355 --> 18:34.821
The best...


250
18:34.990 --> 18:37.584
He won the "Golden Tripe"
in Caen in '36.


251
18:37.759 --> 18:40.750
His brother supplies him with pork.


252
18:42.529 --> 18:43.655
Black market?


253
18:44.332 --> 18:45.628
Small... very, small.


254
18:46.601 --> 18:47.932
You must think big.


255
18:48.737 --> 18:50.829
I've tried to drill that in to him.


256
18:51.673 --> 18:53.538
It's a friend's birthday tomorrow...


257
18:53.708 --> 18:56.006
Would you organize something?


258
18:56.443 --> 18:58.275
Prepare a nice buffet.


259
19:01.615 --> 19:04.517
Are you listening, Leon?
I need eggs...


260
19:04.685 --> 19:06.210
Move over, Daddy!


261
19:06.387 --> 19:08.948
Butter, flour, foie gras...


262
19:09.391 --> 19:12.484
Goose pat, a dozen chickens.


263
19:12.661 --> 19:14.390
You could help!


264
19:14.561 --> 19:16.586
I'm ordering from my brother.


265
19:17.565 --> 19:19.192
2 suckling pigs...


266
19:19.366 --> 19:21.926
What else?
Smoked bacon.


267
19:24.439 --> 19:25.929
Talk about heavy.


268
19:26.273 --> 19:29.505
It's ugly too.
I want something modern.


269
19:29.678 --> 19:31.669
When Dad starts making money...


270
19:31.846 --> 19:33.244
That'll be the day!


271
19:33.414 --> 19:35.508
Don't say that. He's on a roll.


272
19:35.817 --> 19:36.806
Let's hope it lasts.


273
19:36.984 --> 19:39.578
"Let's Hope It Lasts,"
great title!


274
19:39.954 --> 19:41.582
I see you work quickly.


275
19:41.756 --> 19:44.316
- What do you think?
- A bit bare.


276
19:44.491 --> 19:46.857
But it has its charms...


277
19:47.028 --> 19:49.724
Take a look
at your room Pierre-Jean.


278
19:51.000 --> 19:53.332
Separate rooms until we're married.


279
20:07.817 --> 20:10.250
- Delivery.
- You were here yesterday.


280
20:10.419 --> 20:11.909
They say me come today.


281
20:12.421 --> 20:13.580
Your papers, please.


282
20:17.926 --> 20:21.384
Me, caterer for colonel Spreich,
for the...


283
20:21.564 --> 20:23.691
Speak normally.
I understand perfectly.


284
20:31.574 --> 20:33.973
Come in.
The bedroom's overthere.


285
20:42.084 --> 20:43.813
Any good furniture?


286
20:44.720 --> 20:45.913
Junk.


287
20:46.654 --> 20:49.488
Except for a new delivery van.


288
20:50.726 --> 20:52.022
Here's the beast.


289
20:52.994 --> 20:54.428
For your kids.


290
20:55.830 --> 20:57.798
- It needs a paint job.
- Yeah.


291
20:59.902 --> 21:01.028
Edmond, come see.


292
21:01.303 --> 21:02.930
- What's this?
- Look.


293
21:06.474 --> 21:08.704
You dreamed of it,
Germany provided it.


294
21:09.278 --> 21:10.608
Rations for gas.


295
21:11.446 --> 21:12.743
This is too much.


296
21:14.383 --> 21:15.974
Careful, wet paint.


297
21:23.858 --> 21:25.019
Be right back.


298
21:26.694 --> 21:28.390
I'll get another one.


299
21:29.865 --> 21:33.231
You swine, neverthought
my brotherwould be living here.


300
21:33.402 --> 21:35.596
Property is cheap these days.


301
21:35.770 --> 21:36.964
Like my produce.


302
21:37.306 --> 21:39.933
- I pay for it.
- Then you hike up the price!


303
21:40.976 --> 21:42.772
Why don't you shout it out.


304
21:43.078 --> 21:44.910
I may raise my prices.


305
21:45.080 --> 21:47.276
- My expenses are high.
- I see.


306
21:47.450 --> 21:49.974
- I'm just renting.
- It's not free.


307
21:51.319 --> 21:52.287
Just about.


308
21:55.790 --> 21:57.383
- Cheers.
- Thank you.


309
21:58.493 --> 21:59.653
Some champagne?


310
21:59.929 --> 22:02.796
We weren't satisfied
with the last operation.


311
22:02.964 --> 22:06.798
We expected 30,000 Jews.
12,000 arrests isn't much.


312
22:06.969 --> 22:08.630
The French police
are doing their best.


313
22:08.804 --> 22:11.328
Do better, Pierre-Jean.
Do better.


314
22:11.640 --> 22:15.666
We need an independent force...
a militia working for our cause.


315
22:15.845 --> 22:17.539
We need money for that.


316
22:20.849 --> 22:22.214
"Can I top you up?"


317
22:22.384 --> 22:23.851
What do you mean?


318
22:24.319 --> 22:25.651
It's a French expression.


319
22:26.288 --> 22:27.653
What's the French language?


320
22:27.990 --> 22:29.287
Gallic.


321
22:29.525 --> 22:32.392
The Gallic language
barely has 20 words.


322
22:32.560 --> 22:34.825
In 10 years, French won't exist.


323
22:34.997 --> 22:38.329
Excuse me, Daddy.
This is Edwige, my neighbor.


324
22:38.500 --> 22:41.026
Haven't we met already?


325
22:41.804 --> 22:43.931
At the premiere of
"The Killer lives at nï¿½ 21."


326
22:44.940 --> 22:46.931
"The Killer lives at nï¿½ 21,"


327
22:47.276 --> 22:49.801
Excellent title,
don't you think Pierre-Jean?


328
22:51.347 --> 22:52.576
Excuse me...


329
22:53.849 --> 22:54.612
Edmond, the door!


330
22:56.019 --> 22:57.451
I've only got two legs.


331
23:03.759 --> 23:05.317
Is my daddy here?


332
23:05.761 --> 23:06.386
Daddy?


333
23:08.397 --> 23:08.864
My father.


334
23:14.471 --> 23:15.903
- Listen...
- Why are you here?


335
23:16.839 --> 23:18.740
It's not your home anymore.


336
23:21.678 --> 23:22.804
Are those Germans?


337
23:24.280 --> 23:27.875
They're friends of Pierre-Jean.
You can't stay.


338
23:28.785 --> 23:32.016
It's my home now...
I have the papers. It's legal.


339
23:32.355 --> 23:33.981
Sorry, you have to leave.


340
23:34.324 --> 23:37.555
My things are in my room.
My books, violin...


341
23:37.861 --> 23:38.827
It's all gone!


342
23:39.296 --> 23:40.626
- Where?
- I don't know.


343
23:43.666 --> 23:45.964
The SS took it all.


344
23:46.435 --> 23:47.334
Why?


345
23:47.503 --> 23:49.596
I don't know.
I don't make the laws.


346
23:50.507 --> 23:52.941
- What's your name again?
- Simon.


347
23:53.576 --> 23:55.703
Go or we'll both be in trouble.


348
23:58.347 --> 24:01.545
Can I have something to eat?
It's been three days.


349
24:02.885 --> 24:05.286
- In the camp...
- I don't want to know!


350
24:09.925 --> 24:12.258
I'll feed you, but not here.


351
24:12.429 --> 24:14.659
Go to the servant's quarters.


352
24:15.565 --> 24:16.531
Hurry up.


353
24:22.404 --> 24:23.598
Wrong apartment.


354
24:35.785 --> 24:36.682
How did you get here?


355
24:36.853 --> 24:39.821
They took us to a station.
We were getting on a train.


356
24:39.990 --> 24:43.857
My dad said run. I ran.
I didn't look back.


357
24:44.027 --> 24:46.018
- When was that?
- 3 days ago.


358
24:46.363 --> 24:49.298
When I stopped running,
no one was behind me.


359
24:49.665 --> 24:50.894
What did you do?


360
24:51.067 --> 24:52.625
I walked at night.


361
24:52.801 --> 24:56.294
Then a nice lady gave me
money for the train.


362
24:56.538 --> 24:58.268
Dad said to meet here.


363
24:58.441 --> 25:00.432
You misunderstood.
Which room?


364
25:00.609 --> 25:01.541
Here.


365
25:08.984 --> 25:12.785
You can stay till morning.
I don't want to see you after that.


366
25:12.955 --> 25:15.856
By helping you, I'm at risk.


367
25:18.428 --> 25:19.894
There's no heat?


368
25:20.797 --> 25:21.422
No.


369
25:21.730 --> 25:22.355
Why?


370
25:22.531 --> 25:24.590
- It's summer!
- I'm cold.


371
25:24.901 --> 25:26.561
Sorry. No heat!


372
25:27.836 --> 25:30.896
Your dad decided not
to heat the servant's quarters.


373
25:31.775 --> 25:35.471
How did your maid manage?
Ask your dad when you see him.


374
25:36.479 --> 25:37.445
If I find him.


375
25:37.614 --> 25:38.944
You'll find him.


376
25:39.281 --> 25:41.272
- How?
- Do you have family in Paris?


377
25:41.684 --> 25:43.346
Cousins, near Montmartre.


378
25:43.519 --> 25:46.490
He's probably there...
I'll get some food.


379
25:46.656 --> 25:47.953
Could I have a drink?


380
25:48.759 --> 25:51.886
Yes, but stay right here!
I'm locking you in.


381
25:58.336 --> 26:00.861
Just my luck.
This is all I need!


382
26:07.478 --> 26:09.412
- Where were you?
- Getting champagne.


383
26:09.579 --> 26:12.276
- Where is it?
- I forgot the keys!


384
26:13.851 --> 26:16.318
Everyone's asking for you,
Herr Batignole.


385
26:16.487 --> 26:16.952
Coming!


386
26:17.288 --> 26:18.277
You need a hand?


387
26:18.455 --> 26:21.823
No, my kitchen is my own domain.
Get out!


388
26:45.715 --> 26:47.615
- What are you doing?
- Don't mind me.


389
27:33.230 --> 27:34.821
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, sir.


390
27:34.999 --> 27:37.262
- Your studies going well?
- Yes.


391
27:38.435 --> 27:39.800
Where's the bubbly!


392
27:39.970 --> 27:41.368
- I'm going!
- Upstairs?


393
27:41.905 --> 27:44.203
I didn't want them
stolen in the cellar.


394
27:44.375 --> 27:46.934
- You're white as a ghost!
- It's nothing!


395
27:47.278 --> 27:49.472
- I'll get them.
- No, you cut the cake!


396
27:50.047 --> 27:50.705
I'm coming.


397
28:14.971 --> 28:17.805
Not only do you just show up,
but you've got lice!


398
28:17.974 --> 28:21.775
Where I was, there was
only one toilet for200 people!


399
28:21.945 --> 28:24.914
One bar of soap cost
the same as 100 bars...


400
28:25.249 --> 28:29.515
A cigarette cost one chicken.
People paid for a puff.


401
28:30.688 --> 28:32.883
Business is business,
everywhere.


402
28:34.023 --> 28:35.855
- It's cold.
- I can shave it.


403
28:36.026 --> 28:37.960
- No.
- Then stop complaining!


404
28:47.506 --> 28:48.268
What?


405
28:48.440 --> 28:49.737
What are you doing?


406
28:50.842 --> 28:52.537
I'm on the throne!


407
28:52.743 --> 28:54.404
Are you spending the day?


408
28:54.578 --> 28:56.773
However long it takes.
Leave me alone!


409
29:18.936 --> 29:22.201
Your parents can't say
I didn't take care of you.


410
29:22.374 --> 29:25.172
- Was it good?
- I threw up in the bucket.


411
29:25.343 --> 29:26.833
What a waste of foie gras.


412
29:27.578 --> 29:28.840
Can I have some tea?


413
29:29.013 --> 29:31.574
I've been running
up and down since 6 am!


414
29:31.750 --> 29:34.445
- Can you empty the bucket?
- The toilet's out there!


415
29:34.685 --> 29:37.382
You locked me in
and said not to move.


416
29:39.257 --> 29:40.690
Some day off!


417
29:46.263 --> 29:47.730
Hello, Paul.


418
29:47.932 --> 29:49.923
Did you rent your room?


419
29:50.468 --> 29:52.731
- No, why?
- I heard some noise.


420
29:52.903 --> 29:54.997
My brother's son has typhus.


421
29:55.574 --> 29:57.439
You'd better stay away.


422
30:06.284 --> 30:07.478
Can I have a book?


423
30:09.019 --> 30:12.318
Pierre-Jean has books.
I doubt you'd enjoy them.


424
30:12.891 --> 30:14.482
You don't read?


425
30:14.659 --> 30:17.958
I'm up at 5 am
and don't go to bed till 10 pm.


426
30:18.296 --> 30:19.523
And I work non-stop in between.


427
30:19.698 --> 30:21.893
- I didn't know.
- Now you do.


428
30:22.500 --> 30:24.661
If someone knocks,
don't answer.


429
30:25.269 --> 30:26.669
What about my parents?


430
30:26.837 --> 30:28.430
We'll talk later.


431
30:31.675 --> 30:32.700
Here.


432
30:37.781 --> 30:39.682
They were mine
when I was young.


433
30:49.928 --> 30:52.726
It's so humid.
My legs are like lead.


434
30:53.365 --> 30:56.266
I feel a storm coming.


435
30:57.102 --> 30:58.830
Do you have lice?


436
30:59.069 --> 31:02.198
I was itching all night.
So was your father.


437
31:02.374 --> 31:04.637
Your party was a success.


438
31:06.277 --> 31:07.574
Are you listening?


439
31:07.746 --> 31:09.976
Spreich should stop
lecturing me.


440
31:10.548 --> 31:13.744
He wasn't happy with the round-up.
But he does nothing.


441
31:13.917 --> 31:15.977
- Now they want kids!
- That's different...


442
31:16.320 --> 31:18.618
How so?
Don't you agree, Edmond?


443
31:19.923 --> 31:21.255
I wasn't following.


444
31:22.259 --> 31:24.592
He was speaking of
Jewish children.


445
31:25.663 --> 31:26.460
Which ones?


446
31:28.532 --> 31:29.396
What a pig!


447
31:31.068 --> 31:33.866
Pork pat, dipped in coffee.
Not in this apartment.


448
31:34.873 --> 31:37.932
You don't know
what you're missing. Try it.


449
31:38.710 --> 31:40.644
- I'll pass.
- You don't like anything.


450
31:41.779 --> 31:43.612
He loves Micheline, right?


451
31:43.782 --> 31:46.411
Absolutely...
Since we're on the subject,


452
31:46.585 --> 31:49.816
may I have the honor of
asking for your...


453
31:50.355 --> 31:51.846
Not that again!


454
31:57.630 --> 31:59.393
Why didn't you let him finish?


455
31:59.565 --> 32:01.931
It's not the first time
he's asked.


456
32:02.334 --> 32:04.597
- He's so good to us!
- It's my life!


457
32:10.241 --> 32:11.573
Hands up!


458
32:11.743 --> 32:14.440
Don't make us shoot...
Too bad.


459
32:18.951 --> 32:21.351
- It's coffee?
- I couldn't get tea.


460
32:21.519 --> 32:23.953
It'll settle your stomach.


461
32:24.289 --> 32:24.914
What's that?


462
32:25.257 --> 32:27.019
It's pork pat.
My speciality.


463
32:27.358 --> 32:28.883
I don't eat pork.


464
32:29.528 --> 32:31.722
There's also homemade jam,


465
32:31.896 --> 32:34.525
good bread, real butter
and an apple.


466
32:35.067 --> 32:37.330
- Will you see my cousins?
- I'll call.


467
32:37.737 --> 32:39.227
Jews can't use phones.


468
32:40.472 --> 32:42.236
Everything's against the law for us.


469
32:42.641 --> 32:43.903
That's the Germans' fault.


470
32:44.076 --> 32:47.511
No, the French.
We've had no phone for a year.


471
32:47.913 --> 32:49.813
We're not allowed good jobs.


472
32:49.981 --> 32:52.040
I know a Jewish butcher.


473
32:52.484 --> 32:53.781
All Jews can't do that job.


474
32:54.420 --> 32:55.886
Where are your cousins?


475
32:56.489 --> 32:57.682
You turned in my father.


476
32:59.959 --> 33:01.550
You knew the police were coming.


477
33:03.028 --> 33:05.894
Why would I do that?
I'm in business, Simon.


478
33:06.231 --> 33:07.699
I like to make money.


479
33:08.032 --> 33:10.900
- You can make money that way.
- Not me.


480
33:11.237 --> 33:12.295
You live in my home.


481
33:13.506 --> 33:15.769
- They made me.
- Who?


482
33:16.442 --> 33:18.603
If I had denounced you...


483
33:18.778 --> 33:22.373
with the Germans last night,
I could have done it again.


484
33:22.615 --> 33:24.640
You said we stole your hams.


485
33:26.384 --> 33:29.376
Why would I do that?
You don't eat pork!


486
33:29.555 --> 33:31.614
My dad said you accused him.


487
33:31.790 --> 33:34.851
- Your dad made it up!
- Are you saying he lied?


488
33:35.027 --> 33:36.857
I am not accusing anyone!


489
33:37.028 --> 33:39.826
Everyone lies...
Me, my wife, your parents,


490
33:39.999 --> 33:41.796
the radio, the news...


491
33:41.967 --> 33:45.960
If everyone told the truth,
we'd be at war!


492
33:46.305 --> 33:47.363
We are at war!


493
34:17.936 --> 34:18.961
Yes?


494
34:20.605 --> 34:22.300
- Hello Ma'am...
- Sir?


495
34:22.474 --> 34:24.738
I'm looking for the Cohens.


496
34:27.746 --> 34:29.235
Are you family?


497
34:29.414 --> 34:30.711
Not at all.


498
34:31.016 --> 34:32.846
Then what do you want?


499
34:33.051 --> 34:35.519
Mr. Cohen's a friend.


500
34:35.688 --> 34:36.711
A friend?


501
34:36.889 --> 34:39.881
An acquaintance of an acquaintance,


502
34:40.059 --> 34:42.824
of a neighbor in my building,
on rue Sivel.


503
34:44.530 --> 34:45.519
Come in.


504
34:46.632 --> 34:48.793
- They do live here?
- Not entirely.


505
34:49.269 --> 34:50.930
The parents are in Vel d'hiv.


506
34:51.270 --> 34:53.831
- The bicycle stadium?
- Yes.


507
34:54.007 --> 34:57.306
They were arrested
and taken there 3 days ago!


508
34:57.711 --> 35:00.873
They left a small token,
but I can't keep them.


509
35:04.284 --> 35:06.751
Me neither!
I have one in my cellar!


510
35:07.253 --> 35:07.719
A Jew?


511
35:07.887 --> 35:09.219
Bernstein isn't Irish.


512
35:09.389 --> 35:11.550
David or Simon?


513
35:11.724 --> 35:12.418
Bernstein.


514
35:13.226 --> 35:15.489
- There's tons of them.
- Not on rue Sivel.


515
35:15.661 --> 35:18.460
- They're gone.
- Not the one in your cellar!


516
35:18.931 --> 35:22.561
Listen, I came
to find Simon's relatives.


517
35:22.735 --> 35:24.396
Since they're not here...


518
35:24.570 --> 35:26.266
They're your friends.


519
35:26.438 --> 35:27.565
- Who?
- The Cohens.


520
35:27.740 --> 35:28.900
I don't know them!


521
35:29.242 --> 35:30.936
We know you.
He's our cousin.


522
35:31.277 --> 35:32.302
There you go.


523
35:32.478 --> 35:34.947
I'm not Jewish.
I've been French for ages.


524
35:35.282 --> 35:35.976
So have we.


525
35:36.516 --> 35:39.211
I can't keep them.
A cop lives upstairs.


526
35:39.385 --> 35:40.943
I live with a collaborator!


527
35:41.288 --> 35:42.949
But you're hiding the kid.


528
35:43.289 --> 35:45.315
We all have our cross to bear.


529
36:10.416 --> 36:12.282
Red light, green light, 123...


530
36:14.454 --> 36:15.215
Simon!


531
36:15.855 --> 36:16.514
Come here now!


532
36:22.262 --> 36:22.989
It's slippery.


533
36:23.463 --> 36:25.293
That's the fun part.


534
36:27.900 --> 36:29.800
- You're nuts!
- They're school friends.


535
36:29.969 --> 36:31.869
There are no friends
during war.


536
36:32.338 --> 36:33.465
Did you find my parents?


537
36:36.809 --> 36:38.835
But I've been thinking...


538
36:39.012 --> 36:43.641
Before you were arrested,
what was the plan?


539
36:43.817 --> 36:46.307
To go to Switzerland,
with Mr. Morel.


540
36:46.485 --> 36:47.679
He smuggles Jews?


541
36:47.987 --> 36:50.717
I don't know.
He makes head stones.


542
36:50.956 --> 36:52.014
There you go.


543
36:52.358 --> 36:55.327
Maybe your parents
made it to Switzerland.


544
36:55.494 --> 36:57.018
Why don't I have any news?


545
36:57.364 --> 37:00.231
They don't know
you're here, nitwit.


546
37:00.666 --> 37:03.329
I'll find this Morel guy.
It can't be hard.


547
37:03.503 --> 37:03.969
And then?


548
37:04.304 --> 37:05.498
He'll take you to them.


549
37:05.804 --> 37:07.568
What if I don't find them?


550
37:07.974 --> 37:09.771
What if they were arrested?


551
37:16.382 --> 37:18.577
When you escaped...


552
37:19.719 --> 37:21.311
You didn't look back.


553
37:22.655 --> 37:24.485
Maybe you ran faster.


554
37:25.224 --> 37:29.456
Just because you didn't see them,
doesn't mean they were arrested.


555
37:29.829 --> 37:31.456
But it's possible.


556
37:32.865 --> 37:35.766
It's possible,
but maybe it isn't that bad.


557
37:37.036 --> 37:40.235
With Pierre-Jean around,
I should know.


558
37:40.407 --> 37:43.706
They take you to Germany
to break stones for roads.


559
37:43.978 --> 37:46.572
Do children break stones, too?


560
37:47.648 --> 37:48.579
Yes.


561
37:49.050 --> 37:51.574
Small stones with small hammers.


562
37:56.322 --> 37:59.918
You know I can't keep you here.
In Switzerland...


563
38:00.260 --> 38:02.626
You'll have to pay Mr. Morel.


564
38:02.797 --> 38:04.161
Your dad already did.


565
38:04.331 --> 38:06.697
He'll say it's not true.
He's no good.


566
38:06.867 --> 38:09.233
He took off
when the police came.


567
38:09.402 --> 38:11.597
When did your father meet him?


568
38:11.905 --> 38:13.498
During the war in 1914.


569
38:14.809 --> 38:18.744
- Your father fought in the war?
- Yes... I want to stay here.


570
38:19.213 --> 38:20.702
I can't keep you here.


571
38:21.414 --> 38:24.577
Here you're ticking a bomb,
in Switzerland you won't explode.


572
38:31.025 --> 38:33.186
The kid's going to kill me.


573
38:38.632 --> 38:41.862
My rations haven't come in.
Come back later.


574
38:50.677 --> 38:51.974
Anybody here?


575
39:04.324 --> 39:05.552
What do you want?


576
39:06.559 --> 39:08.460
I'm looking for Mr. Morel.


577
39:09.195 --> 39:10.163
What for?


578
39:10.331 --> 39:12.161
Business.


579
39:12.432 --> 39:14.628
20,000 for me.
The same for the smuggler.


580
39:14.934 --> 39:15.594
40,000!


581
39:16.003 --> 39:18.869
You're quick.
Paid on delivery.


582
39:19.739 --> 39:20.865
He's just a kid.


583
39:21.307 --> 39:22.605
The risks are the same.


584
39:25.945 --> 39:27.173
Here.


585
39:28.548 --> 39:29.675
Where did you get it?


586
39:30.016 --> 39:32.780
Someone owed me money...
50,000 francs.


587
39:35.722 --> 39:37.190
Some deal.


588
39:37.458 --> 39:39.949
For the other guy.
It's fake.


589
39:40.793 --> 39:41.726
I don't believe it.


590
39:41.896 --> 39:44.557
Someone tried
to pawn it off on me, too.


591
39:44.998 --> 39:46.295
Nice clients.


592
39:46.599 --> 39:47.726
Could be the same.


593
39:49.269 --> 39:50.862
Bernstein right?


594
39:52.273 --> 39:53.739
Something like that.


595
39:54.340 --> 39:56.434
He's got financial troubles.


596
39:56.610 --> 39:59.443
So he says.
You ever seen his place?


597
39:59.612 --> 40:00.579
No.


598
40:00.748 --> 40:02.409
The furniture's not cheap.


599
40:02.583 --> 40:05.677
His Renoir is worth
everything I own here!


600
40:06.719 --> 40:07.344
Renoir?


601
40:07.788 --> 40:09.983
It's a painting of a kid.
Not bad.


602
40:10.523 --> 40:12.458
He should've paid you with that.


603
40:13.293 --> 40:14.659
Is a Renoir expensive?


604
40:14.827 --> 40:16.226
You idiot.


605
40:16.396 --> 40:18.626
Some go for a million.


606
40:21.635 --> 40:23.500
If I get the painting,


607
40:24.038 --> 40:24.800
will you take the kid?


608
40:25.940 --> 40:26.963
You want him gone?


609
40:27.807 --> 40:29.434
I want to save him.


610
40:30.878 --> 40:34.369
OK, but their things were taken
when they were arrested.


611
40:36.016 --> 40:37.414
Really?


612
40:37.751 --> 40:38.740
A few weeks ago.


613
40:39.353 --> 40:41.288
You know how it goes.


614
40:44.025 --> 40:45.458
If I get the painting,


615
40:45.960 --> 40:48.293
will you take him?


616
40:48.929 --> 40:49.554
Yes or no?


617
40:51.032 --> 40:54.432
Sure, but you're taking a risk
for nothing.


618
40:55.603 --> 40:57.003
For nothing?


619
41:01.643 --> 41:02.666
Not too thin.


620
41:02.844 --> 41:05.574
25 grams. I don't make the rules.


621
41:06.847 --> 41:08.873
Look, that's 28 grams.


622
41:09.050 --> 41:12.541
Like I say, we lost the war,
not our appetites.


623
41:12.786 --> 41:16.847
When you're done jabbering,
can I pay? It's been hours.


624
41:17.925 --> 41:19.552
Here's your change.


625
41:19.793 --> 41:22.489
- Sorry.
- Leave it. I'll sweep it up.


626
41:26.001 --> 41:27.400
Lost your keys?


627
41:27.568 --> 41:30.538
I rented my room
to Edwige and her boyfriend.


628
41:31.273 --> 41:32.331
Really?


629
41:41.483 --> 41:41.972
When do we go?


630
41:42.583 --> 41:45.815
In three days, with Mr. Morel.
He's a good guy.


631
41:47.355 --> 41:48.981
- Is it expensive?
- It's nothing.


632
41:49.324 --> 41:51.349
He knows it's you.


633
41:51.525 --> 41:53.356
He said your dad paid a bundle.


634
41:54.528 --> 41:55.018
He did?


635
41:55.764 --> 41:56.923
Absolutely.


636
41:57.798 --> 41:59.925
You're in good hands.


637
42:03.271 --> 42:04.704
What if we don't make it?


638
42:04.873 --> 42:06.465
I'm not going.


639
42:09.476 --> 42:11.206
My business doesn't run itself.


640
42:12.514 --> 42:13.503
Are you done yet?


641
42:18.420 --> 42:19.751
Is that a German?


642
42:25.626 --> 42:26.650
What's going on?


643
42:26.894 --> 42:27.862
I told you.


644
42:30.597 --> 42:31.826
Got a problem Edmond?


645
42:32.434 --> 42:33.264
I'm fine!


646
42:33.434 --> 42:35.960
Not you.
Someone's banging on the wall.


647
42:36.471 --> 42:38.461
It's my brother. He's very sick.


648
42:38.806 --> 42:39.431
Sick?


649
42:39.673 --> 42:40.333
Typhus.


650
42:40.974 --> 42:41.599
Typhus?


651
42:45.512 --> 42:48.414
You ruined my orgasm!


652
42:48.583 --> 42:50.483
It wasn't me, Colonel!


653
42:51.485 --> 42:53.248
- Nice work!
- Can't a girl have fun?


654
42:53.420 --> 42:53.978
With a Kraut?


655
42:54.322 --> 42:56.414
- What about Pierre-Jean?
- He's French!


656
42:56.590 --> 42:57.717
Sold out, like you!


657
42:57.891 --> 42:59.518
I don't sleep with the enemy!


658
42:59.693 --> 43:01.525
- Time to pay up.
- No way.


659
43:03.664 --> 43:04.757
Who's in your room?


660
43:04.932 --> 43:07.333
- My brother.
- Yesterday it was his son.


661
43:07.501 --> 43:08.661
There'll be nobody soon!


662
43:08.836 --> 43:11.806
Then you can rent your room
to the German army!


663
43:17.445 --> 43:21.472
I don't trust Spreich.
He could send his men up there.


664
43:22.016 --> 43:23.847
But he loves a French girl.


665
43:25.586 --> 43:26.211
It's no crime.


666
43:26.621 --> 43:27.985
It's disgusting,


667
43:28.556 --> 43:30.023
like Pierre-Jean
and your daughter.


668
43:30.791 --> 43:33.454
She doesn't sleep with him.
That's his problem.


669
43:33.961 --> 43:34.860
Why are they together?


670
43:35.563 --> 43:36.655
I wonder.


671
43:37.432 --> 43:39.594
Mind your own business.
Into bed now.


672
43:42.605 --> 43:45.835
It's not ideal,
but I'll feel betterwith you here.


673
43:47.675 --> 43:49.233
What about yourwife?


674
43:49.411 --> 43:51.402
There's only one key.


675
43:53.047 --> 43:54.036
Can you leave the light?


676
43:54.516 --> 43:56.451
Someone might notice.


677
43:59.954 --> 44:01.512
I'm scared of the dark.


678
44:02.490 --> 44:04.481
You're safe in the dark.


679
44:05.728 --> 44:07.525
- Edmond!
- Coming!


680
44:08.597 --> 44:11.259
- What are you doing?
- Storing champagne!


681
44:52.807 --> 44:55.971
- I'm not a pig!
- You scared me.


682
44:56.311 --> 44:57.643
I'm bleeding!


683
44:58.079 --> 45:00.014
- You're drenched.
- I'm bleeding!


684
45:00.349 --> 45:01.873
Get Doctor Bernstein!


685
45:02.217 --> 45:03.309
He's gone, my sausage.


686
45:03.485 --> 45:05.476
- Where are we?
- His apartment.


687
45:06.621 --> 45:07.713
What's that noise?


688
45:07.889 --> 45:09.380
Pierre-Jean's typing.


689
45:09.557 --> 45:10.889
What's he typing on?


690
45:11.226 --> 45:12.751
On his typewriter.


691
45:12.927 --> 45:14.827
You're not well at all.


692
45:14.996 --> 45:16.931
You've no reason
to be anxious.


693
45:17.266 --> 45:18.994
Calm down now.


694
45:26.442 --> 45:28.568
It's for my son-in-law.


695
45:28.744 --> 45:30.905
He's got business
with Colonel Spreich.


696
45:46.896 --> 45:50.228
July... 9... 11... 14...


697
45:50.798 --> 45:53.460
July 15... Bernstein.
Here it is.


698
45:54.603 --> 45:56.764
Max... rue Sivel.


699
45:57.338 --> 46:00.706
Taken between 9:17 and 11:32,


700
46:01.809 --> 46:03.505
by Colonel Spreich.


701
46:03.679 --> 46:05.873
Talk about precision,
those Germans.


702
46:06.282 --> 46:07.771
It's regulations.


703
46:09.217 --> 46:11.777
All their things are in aisle 27.


704
46:12.954 --> 46:13.579
That's it.


705
46:13.822 --> 46:15.311
I've a list of furniture.


706
46:15.490 --> 46:18.460
What timing.
It's going to Germany in 2 days.


707
46:18.893 --> 46:21.795
27... here it is.
Section B is at the far end.


708
46:23.231 --> 46:23.994
It's incredible!


709
46:24.333 --> 46:25.925
You should see the pianos.


710
46:26.268 --> 46:29.498
Hundreds of pianos lined up.
It's extraordinary.


711
46:30.572 --> 46:31.561
Incredible.


712
46:32.775 --> 46:34.367
Here it is. Bernstein.


713
46:35.945 --> 46:38.505
- What are you looking for?
- A Louis XV chest.


714
46:39.315 --> 46:42.717
- It's not on my list.
- But I saw them take it away.


715
46:43.286 --> 46:46.016
The officer in charge
often helps himself.


716
46:46.356 --> 46:48.380
I'd check Spreich's office
if I were you.


717
46:48.557 --> 46:50.992
He's a fanatic... for Louis XV.


718
46:51.827 --> 46:52.590
What can I say?


719
46:52.963 --> 46:55.431
I could've gotten a head start.


720
46:55.831 --> 46:57.992
As usual, you don't tell me a thing.


721
46:58.400 --> 47:00.231
I wonderwhat you do all day long?


722
47:00.402 --> 47:01.494
You think this stuff is heaven sent?


723
47:01.670 --> 47:03.536
Stop bickering.


724
47:03.940 --> 47:06.773
- It's heavy.
- I don't have four arms.


725
47:08.311 --> 47:09.938
Don't get your hands dirty.


726
47:10.280 --> 47:13.181
"Don't Get Your Hands Dirty."
Excellent title.


727
47:13.682 --> 47:15.650
How about "Lazy Bones" instead?


728
47:16.353 --> 47:17.512
I'll note that.


729
47:21.358 --> 47:24.418
- After my delivery, we're going.
- You're coming too?


730
47:24.594 --> 47:26.925
No. I'm taking you to Morel.
That's it.


731
47:27.896 --> 47:29.454
Move your junk.


732
47:29.632 --> 47:32.500
Air raids are expected
and people use cellars.


733
47:32.668 --> 47:34.728
If they find you here, I'm finished.


734
47:36.505 --> 47:37.802
It's just a storm.


735
48:07.670 --> 48:10.503
Get the rest from the truck.


736
48:48.777 --> 48:49.869
Looking for something?


737
48:50.045 --> 48:51.911
Colonel Spreich. I thought I'd...


738
48:52.514 --> 48:53.572
You're bleeding.


739
48:55.050 --> 48:56.278
It's nothing.


740
48:56.452 --> 48:58.545
- I'll get a doctor.
- Don't bother.


741
48:58.722 --> 49:00.621
Don't move.
I'll be right back.


742
49:49.840 --> 49:52.603
I'm Edmond Batignole.
You know me.


743
49:52.777 --> 49:54.710
Me come here every day.


744
49:59.382 --> 50:00.940
That was from before.


745
50:02.052 --> 50:04.782
Truck requisitioned
by my son-in-law.


746
50:04.954 --> 50:06.751
Bad French paint, that's all.


747
50:08.358 --> 50:09.485
- Excuse me?
- Papers for the truck!


748
50:19.503 --> 50:22.233
Me French, not Jew.
Understand?


749
50:25.275 --> 50:27.039
You can go.


750
50:34.451 --> 50:37.476
Colonel,
this is Andrea.


751
50:37.655 --> 50:39.679
I think we have a problem
with Batignole.


752
50:40.791 --> 50:43.054
We started eating.
How was the delivery?


753
50:43.393 --> 50:44.588
I got it in early.


754
50:44.762 --> 50:46.820
Did you hear about your promotion?


755
50:46.996 --> 50:48.362
What's this?


756
50:48.532 --> 50:50.523
Edmond's to be
Gestapo caterer.


757
50:51.668 --> 50:53.260
And the fool doesn't tell us.


758
50:53.704 --> 50:54.500
It's not official.


759
50:54.672 --> 50:57.333
They owe me.
I've been footing the bill.


760
50:57.740 --> 50:58.867
It got you in the door.


761
50:59.777 --> 51:01.300
If there's no contract, I'm out.


762
51:02.413 --> 51:03.208
Don't be such a pig.


763
51:04.347 --> 51:06.679
The Krauts have been
the pigs around here.


764
51:06.851 --> 51:07.545
Sorry, Pierre-Jean.


765
51:08.251 --> 51:09.617
Your scorn is appropriate.


766
51:10.353 --> 51:12.686
Besides, things can still change.


767
51:12.856 --> 51:13.755
Are the winds changing?


768
51:15.592 --> 51:17.458
Well Marguerite,


769
51:17.628 --> 51:21.826
scornful tones must now shift
to more somber ones.


770
51:23.567 --> 51:26.934
Collaborating with the Germans
is fine, if they respect us.


771
51:27.438 --> 51:31.601
We've done a fine job ridding
the country ofJews and terrorists.


772
51:31.775 --> 51:33.402
Now Hitler must do his part.


773
51:33.943 --> 51:34.568
Absolutely.


774
51:34.744 --> 51:37.713
Let's raise our glasses
to a new cleansed France,


775
51:38.449 --> 51:40.041
one that's serene and prosperous.


776
51:40.384 --> 51:43.614
To a revolution led by PÃ©tain.
Vive la France!


777
51:44.755 --> 51:45.449
Vive I'Amour.


778
51:47.858 --> 51:49.449
Let's have champagne!


779
51:49.626 --> 51:50.456
I'll get some.


780
51:50.628 --> 51:51.594
No!


781
51:52.396 --> 51:53.590
You're hiding something.


782
51:53.764 --> 51:56.460
You stop me every time.
It's fishy.


783
51:56.634 --> 51:58.625
Remember, I put it upstairs.


784
51:58.802 --> 52:00.793
- You said you brought it down.
- No. Up.


785
52:00.971 --> 52:02.699
- You bring it up, then down.
- So?


786
52:02.873 --> 52:05.534
- Well it is odd.
- What's odd!


787
52:05.943 --> 52:07.432
Are you OK, Edmond?


788
52:07.610 --> 52:08.474
He's never OK!


789
52:08.646 --> 52:09.373
It's her!


790
52:09.545 --> 52:10.807
- Daddy...
- I've had it with her.


791
52:10.981 --> 52:12.447
That's a new one.


792
52:12.615 --> 52:14.583
It's not new.
You yell constantly.


793
52:14.751 --> 52:17.311
Edmond, you've no guts, no brain.
You're a pig!


794
52:17.487 --> 52:19.887
- Do I treat you like a fat sow?
- Watch it!


795
52:20.056 --> 52:21.887
I'm ashamed of you!
That's my problem.


796
52:22.059 --> 52:22.820
I am ashamed of you!


797
52:22.992 --> 52:26.393
- You're still making my life hell.
- Not much longer!


798
52:27.063 --> 52:28.894
I'll get the champagne.


799
52:39.510 --> 52:40.637
Hold on.


800
52:40.811 --> 52:42.608
It's Colonel Spreich.


801
52:43.914 --> 52:46.349
He wants to talk to Dad.
He seems upset.


802
52:47.018 --> 52:49.043
Yes, Colonel?
This is Pierre-Jean.


803
52:50.288 --> 52:51.481
We're leaving...


804
52:52.556 --> 52:53.818
- What are you doing here?
- Eating.


805
52:54.925 --> 52:55.550
No, them.


806
52:56.594 --> 52:57.059
They're my cousins.


807
52:57.494 --> 53:00.554
I'm already in deep shit,
and you brought them here?


808
53:00.798 --> 53:01.561
I didn't go anywhere.


809
53:01.833 --> 53:04.427
How did they appear?
Was it the Holy Spirit?


810
53:04.735 --> 53:07.364
You told our landlady
Simon was in your cellar.


811
53:07.539 --> 53:09.199
We climbed through the opening.


812
53:09.440 --> 53:11.704
This isn't a summer camp!


813
53:12.610 --> 53:14.271
- Taste good?
- I was hungry.


814
53:14.445 --> 53:14.969
Edmond.


815
53:15.746 --> 53:16.371
Who is it?


816
53:25.289 --> 53:25.914
Edmond.
Open up!


817
53:26.623 --> 53:27.612
Leave me alone.


818
53:27.791 --> 53:30.954
Spreich called.
He wants to see you immediately.


819
53:32.664 --> 53:36.327
He has a few questions.
I'll go with you.


820
53:37.335 --> 53:41.431
- The Gestapo can't be good.
- You can't refuse to see Spreich.


821
53:41.606 --> 53:43.039
He's suspicious lately.


822
53:43.375 --> 53:45.434
I don't know what you mean.
Leave me alone.


823
53:45.610 --> 53:46.507
Open up!


824
53:46.677 --> 53:47.769
Daddy, let us in!


825
53:47.945 --> 53:49.914
Leave me alone
or I'll hang myself!


826
54:08.800 --> 54:10.266
This is the champagne?


827
54:12.269 --> 54:13.567
I know you.


828
54:15.440 --> 54:17.737
Colette and Simone
are Simon's friends.


829
54:17.909 --> 54:18.739
Little whores.


830
54:19.643 --> 54:22.612
Watch your mouth, Pierre-Jean.


831
54:23.414 --> 54:27.010
I put myself out so that
you could live in a fine apartment.


832
54:27.351 --> 54:31.014
Got involved with the SS,
and compromised my art for this.


833
54:31.523 --> 54:33.786
Lowlife scum who sides with Jews.


834
54:33.958 --> 54:37.018
I wouldn't worry about your art.
Even Sacha Guitry...


835
54:37.695 --> 54:39.628
I told Daddy about Mr. Guitry.


836
54:39.797 --> 54:42.460
Daddy's little girl tells all.
How sweet.


837
54:42.634 --> 54:44.829
Call Spreich.
Get him here!


838
54:45.003 --> 54:46.492
- They're just kids.
- Obey me!


839
54:46.704 --> 54:49.264
If you're still my daughter,
don't listen.


840
54:49.574 --> 54:52.702
He's the one who denounced
your family, Simon.


841
54:52.876 --> 54:53.934
He told the police.


842
54:54.278 --> 54:56.679
This time the SS
will be coming for you.


843
54:56.847 --> 54:59.873
- You say you're not a puppet.
- I'm doing my duty!


844
55:00.518 --> 55:02.246
You vermin aren't going to a camp.


845
55:02.686 --> 55:05.315
You'll go directly
to Germany in cattle cars.


846
55:05.489 --> 55:06.786
Everybody upstairs!
Move!


847
55:08.693 --> 55:09.751
We listen to Mr. Edmond.


848
55:12.896 --> 55:14.523
Tell them to go upstairs.


849
55:16.501 --> 55:18.434
Do what he says.
He's sick.


850
55:18.936 --> 55:19.561
I warned you.


851
55:19.737 --> 55:20.704
That's an excellent title!


852
55:21.338 --> 55:22.601
Excellent title.


853
55:23.507 --> 55:26.340
You've got 5 seconds,
or I'll butcher you.


854
55:27.277 --> 55:28.744
Please, Daddy.


855
55:32.550 --> 55:33.916
We'll go, Edmond.


856
56:04.282 --> 56:05.840
Who, Marguerite? Who?


857
56:06.018 --> 56:07.918
Daddy found him
10 minutes ago.


858
56:08.253 --> 56:11.711
- Where's your father?
- At the police station.


859
56:12.891 --> 56:14.586
Will you take hostages?


860
56:15.628 --> 56:17.596
If you don't find the guilty party?


861
56:17.762 --> 56:21.358
Pierre-Jean was a minor
French collaborator,


862
56:21.534 --> 56:23.195
not a German officer.


863
56:24.235 --> 56:25.726
He was more than a son to me.


864
56:25.905 --> 56:28.373
We'll find the person who did this.


865
56:28.541 --> 56:29.905
And he'll pay dearly.


866
56:35.681 --> 56:38.206
Skin him alive!


867
56:48.561 --> 56:50.552
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.


868
56:54.699 --> 56:56.690
- Open up.
- Now what?


869
56:56.869 --> 56:57.994
Open up.


870
57:02.875 --> 57:04.536
Where did you two disappear?


871
57:06.512 --> 57:08.275
They came to see their cousin.


872
57:08.447 --> 57:11.438
A man wanted to take us to a camp,
but he saved us.


873
57:11.617 --> 57:13.585
He killed the man with an ax.


874
57:13.786 --> 57:14.684
I neutralized him.


875
57:14.853 --> 57:17.219
- Then he won't die?
- Of course not.


876
57:17.989 --> 57:21.322
The hospital will sew him up.
Ask Simon. His father knows.


877
57:21.492 --> 57:23.255
You must hide us.
Just tonight.


878
57:25.264 --> 57:26.231
I can't turn you out.


879
57:26.465 --> 57:27.454
Thank you.


880
57:28.434 --> 57:28.900
Want a drink?


881
57:29.434 --> 57:30.833
I'd be delighted.


882
58:17.483 --> 58:20.610
It was Mr. Bernstein's.
His son said he got it from you.


883
58:21.519 --> 58:23.987
Max never finished paying for it.


884
58:25.023 --> 58:27.184
Max was arrested
with his wife and son.


885
58:27.793 --> 58:30.523
I need cash to get
his other son to Switzerland.


886
58:30.697 --> 58:31.856
There are other kids too.


887
58:33.032 --> 58:34.193
Congratulations.


888
58:34.534 --> 58:36.661
I can sell it somewhere else.


889
58:37.269 --> 58:39.237
- I came to you.
- You have no one else.


890
58:46.346 --> 58:47.335
I'll give you 300,000.


891
58:47.514 --> 58:48.775
It'll get a million on auction.


892
58:48.947 --> 58:52.246
It won't go on auction
for another2 or3 months.


893
58:52.818 --> 58:54.012
And you seem in a hurry.


894
58:55.288 --> 58:56.016
300,000 or nothing.


895
58:57.724 --> 58:58.519
Do you have cash?


896
59:01.827 --> 59:02.920
Wait a moment.


897
59:03.262 --> 59:05.458
- May I use your phone?
- Certainly.


898
59:30.523 --> 59:31.784
Is your mother alright?


899
59:32.925 --> 59:33.824
She's busy.


900
59:34.661 --> 59:36.992
All of Vichy Paris
has come out for Pierre-Jean.


901
59:37.963 --> 59:39.931
It's his moment of glory.


902
59:41.034 --> 59:43.969
- The SS is investigating.
- Who do they suspect?


903
59:44.804 --> 59:47.534
Since you left, they have doubts.
Especially Spreich.


904
59:47.706 --> 59:51.005
I heard you rummaged his office.
He wants to make you talk.


905
59:52.045 --> 59:53.204
Says you're a Gaullist.


906
59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.349
Here's 150,000 francs.


907
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:05.923
No questions. I want you both
to stay with my brother in Normandy.


908
01:00:06.358 --> 01:00:06.882
What about you?


909
01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:09.251
I'm taking the kids
to Switzerland.


910
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:15.568
I'm sorry about Pierre-Jean.


911
01:00:15.869 --> 01:00:17.666
- I had no choice.
- Yes you did.


912
01:00:17.971 --> 01:00:21.634
You killed him after he alerted
Spreich. You could've left.


913
01:00:22.474 --> 01:00:24.465
You think he would've let me go?


914
01:00:24.643 --> 01:00:27.545
He would've butchered
the children.


915
01:00:28.782 --> 01:00:29.748
Don't say you loved him.


916
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:32.016
When do you go?


917
01:00:32.985 --> 01:00:33.610
Tonight.


918
01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.717
When will I see you?


919
01:00:36.588 --> 01:00:39.853
I don't know.
I'll call you in a few days.


920
01:00:40.427 --> 01:00:42.452
Why can't a professional take them?


921
01:00:42.728 --> 01:00:43.820
Can't trust them.


922
01:00:43.996 --> 01:00:46.693
It'll be good to take some time off.


923
01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:48.630
There'll be identity checks.


924
01:00:49.668 --> 01:00:53.503
We'll take the night train.
It's safe. We get off at Morteau.


925
01:00:53.873 --> 01:00:55.965
Just before the free zone.


926
01:00:56.876 --> 01:00:59.309
Here are your papers.
What about the kids?


927
01:00:59.778 --> 01:01:01.576
Simon has his fake passport.


928
01:01:01.815 --> 01:01:03.873
- He's clever.
- And the others?


929
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:05.918
I'll work it out.


930
01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:07.742
You won't go farwithout a pass.


931
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.512
I've no choice.


932
01:01:20.532 --> 01:01:22.228
Can't vouch for the quality.


933
01:01:23.902 --> 01:01:25.597
Smile for the birdie.


934
01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:33.869
You know I love you.


935
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.681
Me too.


936
01:01:45.826 --> 01:01:47.418
Be careful, Daddy.


937
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.873
1 adult and 3 children for Morteau.


938
01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:12.483
Ask for a reduction.


939
01:02:12.652 --> 01:02:15.554
What do you think I did?
1 adult, 3 children.


940
01:02:15.722 --> 01:02:16.382
How much is that?


941
01:02:20.994 --> 01:02:22.518
Slow down.


942
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:34.907
And the girls?


943
01:02:35.608 --> 01:02:36.802
They're my daughters.


944
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.976
Their papers?


945
01:02:39.012 --> 01:02:39.980
Of course.


946
01:02:43.851 --> 01:02:44.818
Here.


947
01:02:57.898 --> 01:03:00.458
Their passes were stolen.


948
01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:06.432
You can go.


949
01:03:06.974 --> 01:03:07.940
Thank you so much, Sir.


950
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:32.695
Go to sleep now.


951
01:03:39.773 --> 01:03:41.536
May I buy some bread
for my kids?


952
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:43.367
Of course.


953
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.369
What do you say?


954
01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:48.947
Thank you, Madam.


955
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:51.407
- Some cheese?
- Thanks.


956
01:03:51.585 --> 01:03:52.710
- Some sausage?
- No.


957
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:56.847
They're not fond of meat.


958
01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:00.293
Forget it.


959
01:04:04.331 --> 01:04:05.922
- Is it good?
- Yes.


960
01:04:09.036 --> 01:04:11.697
- Where are you going, Daddy?
- Men's room.


961
01:04:19.278 --> 01:04:19.744
What does he do?


962
01:04:19.913 --> 01:04:21.311
He's a surgeon.


963
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:22.742
That's a nice job.


964
01:04:22.916 --> 01:04:23.541
My Dad...


965
01:04:23.717 --> 01:04:25.344
He's a doctor. Gerard just said so.


966
01:04:25.519 --> 01:04:26.577
Listen when I talk.


967
01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:27.380
How old are you?


968
01:04:27.722 --> 01:04:28.347
Eleven and a half.


969
01:04:28.523 --> 01:04:30.514
I'm 8 and my sister's 11.


970
01:04:31.393 --> 01:04:32.451
Only 6 months apart?


971
01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.818
That was Dad's 2nd marriage.


972
01:04:36.563 --> 01:04:37.326
Right.


973
01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:38.431
Your mom's not here?


974
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.858
We're meeting her.


975
01:04:40.467 --> 01:04:41.730
In the free zone?


976
01:04:41.902 --> 01:04:43.871
Just before.
We're going to Morteau.


977
01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.617
Another check point.


978
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.625
My tummy hurts.


979
01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.690
Let's go through the toilets!


980
01:05:18.572 --> 01:05:19.471
Me?


981
01:05:23.478 --> 01:05:23.943
Thanks.


982
01:05:24.278 --> 01:05:26.371
Your son said you were a doctor.


983
01:05:28.615 --> 01:05:30.378
It's true, Daddy.


984
01:05:44.632 --> 01:05:46.998
He says he fell
when he got off the train.


985
01:05:54.943 --> 01:05:58.434
That hurts? It's normal.
That joint's full of nerves.


986
01:05:58.847 --> 01:06:01.371
With the shin twisted,
it doesn't look good.


987
01:06:01.648 --> 01:06:03.639
I'm afraid I can't help you.


988
01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:06.615
You must go to the hospital
for an operation.


989
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.690
Repair it! Now!


990
01:06:12.693 --> 01:06:14.217
Repair it.


991
01:06:14.996 --> 01:06:16.257
Naturally.


992
01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:19.963
I'm a nurse, doctor.


993
01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.494
Good timing.


994
01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:23.967
I forgot my medical bag
in Paris.


995
01:06:24.304 --> 01:06:25.465
I see.


996
01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:27.900
Was she in our compartment?


997
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:29.670
You'll be fine.


998
01:06:29.844 --> 01:06:31.367
His knee is twisted.


999
01:06:31.545 --> 01:06:32.409
I see that!


1000
01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:34.514
First we'll ease the pain.


1001
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:36.782
What a wimp!


1002
01:06:45.425 --> 01:06:46.483
Do you speak German?


1003
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:48.822
Yes.
English and a little Russian, too.


1004
01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.326
Here doctor.


1005
01:06:57.704 --> 01:06:58.831
Sorry.


1006
01:06:59.673 --> 01:07:01.869
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving a shot.


1007
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:04.201
It's an intravenous shot.


1008
01:07:04.545 --> 01:07:06.309
Oh right.


1009
01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.882
In Paris, I'm chief surgeon.
The help administers the shots.


1010
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.445
That'll do it.


1011
01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:15.884
Go ahead, doctor.


1012
01:07:16.224 --> 01:07:17.418
Yes, the knee.


1013
01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:19.958
- Want me to do it?
- I know my stuff.


1014
01:07:27.902 --> 01:07:28.527
Guess it's painful.


1015
01:07:41.884 --> 01:07:44.215
They didn't even
check our papers.


1016
01:07:44.385 --> 01:07:45.717
Put a lid on it!


1017
01:07:48.858 --> 01:07:50.985
- Thank you.
- Thank your son.


1018
01:07:51.327 --> 01:07:52.418
Have a nice trip.


1019
01:07:53.295 --> 01:07:56.628
If anything happens to the kids,
call a real doctor.


1020
01:08:02.271 --> 01:08:04.262
Relocating a knee is a cinch.


1021
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.876
I did the same for calves as a kid.
I could've been a vet.


1022
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:09.643
Is Switzerland very far?


1023
01:08:09.811 --> 01:08:12.246
- My stories aren't interesting?
- They are.


1024
01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:13.175
I don't think so.


1025
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:15.248
- Can you carry me?
- Yes.


1026
01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:17.442
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.


1027
01:08:17.619 --> 01:08:19.382
You've got fat reserves on you.


1028
01:08:19.655 --> 01:08:21.952
- You ate on the train.
- Not much.


1029
01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.759
The landlady in Paris
made us a snack.


1030
01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:26.917
- I forgot it.
- That was clever.


1031
01:08:27.262 --> 01:08:28.354
Did you remember?


1032
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:30.395
All he does is act like a clown.


1033
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:32.693
I got us out of the station.


1034
01:08:32.868 --> 01:08:35.631
We were lucky to find
a wonderful nurse.


1035
01:08:35.804 --> 01:08:37.567
She didn't speak German.


1036
01:08:37.739 --> 01:08:40.003
It was obvious
he twisted his knee.


1037
01:08:40.342 --> 01:08:41.809
I found out she was a nurse.


1038
01:08:41.976 --> 01:08:45.309
When you went to the toilet,
I did some research.


1039
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.449
- Would you shut up.
- I'm explaining.


1040
01:08:47.615 --> 01:08:49.880
You run off at the mouth
like my wife.


1041
01:08:50.051 --> 01:08:51.519
I'm thirsty.


1042
01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.012
Let's move.


1043
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.666
There's a farm.
I'll get some food.


1044
01:09:08.304 --> 01:09:09.202
Wait for us.


1045
01:09:15.577 --> 01:09:16.873
- Wait here.
- I'm coming.


1046
01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:18.907
No! Stay with your cousins.


1047
01:09:20.315 --> 01:09:21.646
Bring something to drink.


1048
01:09:26.922 --> 01:09:28.617
Very funny!


1049
01:09:32.895 --> 01:09:35.591
How do you know German?


1050
01:09:35.764 --> 01:09:38.561
- It's my native language.
- Was your mother German?


1051
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.567
My mother's French. My father's
German. We left when I was born.


1052
01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:47.398
You said your father fought in WWI.
That means with the Germans?


1053
01:09:48.476 --> 01:09:49.273
I guess so.


1054
01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:52.737
So the shrapnel in my leg...


1055
01:09:52.914 --> 01:09:56.748
the shell that hit the mess hall
could've been sent by your dad.


1056
01:09:57.386 --> 01:09:58.318
He wasn't fighting.


1057
01:09:58.686 --> 01:09:59.779
A shirker.


1058
01:09:59.954 --> 01:10:00.922
He helped the sick.


1059
01:10:01.923 --> 01:10:02.583
I was on the front.


1060
01:10:02.757 --> 01:10:03.985
You said you were a cook.


1061
01:10:05.027 --> 01:10:08.019
In the trenches,
in the midst of bombs and bullets.


1062
01:10:08.797 --> 01:10:10.822
You don't know how lucky you are.


1063
01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:18.833
Darn flies!


1064
01:10:19.007 --> 01:10:20.942
Daddy said to talk nicely to them.


1065
01:10:22.845 --> 01:10:25.610
That's sweet.
Aren't we having a fun here?


1066
01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.574
Fresh air, peace and calm.
No Germans.


1067
01:10:29.753 --> 01:10:31.014
The good life.
Vacation.


1068
01:10:31.854 --> 01:10:34.380
- I'm hot.
- Take off yourtop.


1069
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.322
Forget it.


1070
01:10:36.626 --> 01:10:37.684
Show your boobies.


1071
01:10:39.496 --> 01:10:40.394
You're so stupid.


1072
01:10:41.297 --> 01:10:42.764
It won't get betterwith age.


1073
01:10:45.934 --> 01:10:47.027
Just kidding, Simon.


1074
01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:48.628
You annoy me!


1075
01:10:50.306 --> 01:10:52.672
- Now what?
- Time for a nap.


1076
01:11:24.506 --> 01:11:25.269
Smart move.


1077
01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:26.868
Didn't eat enough?


1078
01:11:27.042 --> 01:11:27.872
I wanted dessert.


1079
01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:29.773
Dessert!


1080
01:11:35.784 --> 01:11:38.685
- That's stealing.
- It's no problem.


1081
01:11:38.954 --> 01:11:39.784
It's me again.


1082
01:11:39.956 --> 01:11:40.581
Do you know her?


1083
01:11:41.623 --> 01:11:43.284
She sold me the cheese.


1084
01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.426
Was it any good?


1085
01:11:44.693 --> 01:11:45.819
- Yes.
- Yes, what?


1086
01:11:46.296 --> 01:11:46.762
Yes, ma'am.


1087
01:11:48.064 --> 01:11:48.927
Where are you?


1088
01:11:49.332 --> 01:11:50.492
With Gerard. I'm coming.


1089
01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:51.792
How many do you have?


1090
01:11:52.635 --> 01:11:53.293
Three.


1091
01:11:53.735 --> 01:11:54.565
Where are you from?


1092
01:11:54.837 --> 01:11:56.668
Paris.
We're going to Switzerland.


1093
01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.773
She's talking to me!


1094
01:11:59.476 --> 01:11:59.942
He'll get me hung.


1095
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:03.411
You're not the first
I've seen in these parts.


1096
01:12:04.414 --> 01:12:05.710
Do they get through?


1097
01:12:06.416 --> 01:12:07.440
Depends on the smuggler.


1098
01:12:07.617 --> 01:12:09.244
- Do you know any?
- Enough Gerard!


1099
01:12:09.418 --> 01:12:11.613
- Stop yelling.
- Be polite!


1100
01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:14.284
Can we talk privately,
because with him...


1101
01:12:14.457 --> 01:12:16.219
Have some juice at the house.


1102
01:12:16.391 --> 01:12:18.724
Get your sisters
and bring my things.


1103
01:12:18.895 --> 01:12:20.452
Then meet me at the house.


1104
01:12:20.797 --> 01:12:22.764
- Do you hear?
- I'm not deaf.


1105
01:12:31.373 --> 01:12:32.704
Hello.


1106
01:12:32.976 --> 01:12:35.967
- Is my father here?
- He's talking to my mother.


1107
01:12:37.814 --> 01:12:39.577
My sisters: Colette and Simone.


1108
01:12:39.748 --> 01:12:41.739
- Hello.
- What are you doing?


1109
01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:43.952
Making a sling to kill crows.


1110
01:12:44.487 --> 01:12:45.248
Why?


1111
01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:46.313
I eat them.


1112
01:12:48.023 --> 01:12:49.854
- What's your name?
- Martin.


1113
01:12:50.393 --> 01:12:51.256
I'm Gerard.


1114
01:12:51.426 --> 01:12:53.327
Is this smuggler reliable?


1115
01:12:53.496 --> 01:12:54.587
Yes.


1116
01:12:56.032 --> 01:12:57.498
Until now.


1117
01:12:58.635 --> 01:13:00.363
I don't know how to thank you.


1118
01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:02.231
Drink while it's hot.


1119
01:13:03.739 --> 01:13:05.833
I'm sure it's better in Paris.


1120
01:13:07.243 --> 01:13:08.869
Where can I find a hotel?


1121
01:13:09.045 --> 01:13:10.876
I can put you up for a night.


1122
01:13:11.047 --> 01:13:12.570
Is it OKwith your husband?


1123
01:13:12.748 --> 01:13:14.876
He's a prisoner in Germany.


1124
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:16.416
I'm sorry.


1125
01:13:16.585 --> 01:13:18.451
You didn't know.


1126
01:13:22.025 --> 01:13:24.619
I'll call the Parnets.


1127
01:13:25.429 --> 01:13:27.420
Let the girls have your room.


1128
01:13:27.597 --> 01:13:29.497
You two take the room upstairs.


1129
01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.327
My other son lives in town.


1130
01:13:31.601 --> 01:13:32.762
Where's he sleeping?


1131
01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:36.305
You could sleep on the sofa.


1132
01:13:36.472 --> 01:13:38.235
That'll be fine.
I'll pay you.


1133
01:13:38.408 --> 01:13:39.932
- No.
- It's the least I can do.


1134
01:13:40.277 --> 01:13:42.609
Keep your money.
I'll be back in an hour.


1135
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.474
Can you kill a rabbit
for dinnertonight?


1136
01:13:45.648 --> 01:13:46.512
I'll handle it.


1137
01:13:51.922 --> 01:13:54.447
- You do this every night?
- Morning and night.


1138
01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:55.724
And if you don't?


1139
01:13:55.893 --> 01:13:56.756
They explode.


1140
01:14:00.831 --> 01:14:02.195
Taste it.


1141
01:14:03.734 --> 01:14:06.668
- It's hot.
- It's not coming from an icebox.


1142
01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:08.235
He's moving.


1143
01:14:08.871 --> 01:14:11.704
It's the nerves.
Didn't your dad teach you that?


1144
01:14:12.408 --> 01:14:12.875
No.


1145
01:14:14.612 --> 01:14:16.476
You've never seen this before.


1146
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.305
Come here, I'll show you
how to skin it.


1147
01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:24.481
Now we'll take off his pajamas.


1148
01:14:26.389 --> 01:14:27.481
You're a monster.


1149
01:14:27.657 --> 01:14:29.626
We'll talk when you're eating it.


1150
01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.021
I'll never eat it.


1151
01:14:31.461 --> 01:14:33.292
Guess you've never been hungry.


1152
01:14:33.463 --> 01:14:35.454
Actually, I have.
That's just it.


1153
01:14:37.268 --> 01:14:39.600
It was only 2 or3 days.


1154
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.032
You pathetic man.


1155
01:14:45.842 --> 01:14:48.811
- Alright! My turn.
- I'll put the bottle back.


1156
01:14:50.014 --> 01:14:51.810
Watch it, I'm coming through!


1157
01:14:53.617 --> 01:14:55.311
Don't aim for people.


1158
01:14:57.621 --> 01:14:59.054
It's delicious. Bravo!


1159
01:14:59.523 --> 01:15:01.547
- Not eating?
- I don't like rabbit.


1160
01:15:01.725 --> 01:15:04.387
- Taste it first.
- It smells bad.


1161
01:15:04.594 --> 01:15:06.460
I made it.


1162
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:08.460
Of course, I can't cook.


1163
01:15:08.631 --> 01:15:10.657
Whatever I do isn't good enough.


1164
01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.300
Can I eat his portion?


1165
01:15:12.469 --> 01:15:15.335
No. He won't leave the table
until he's eaten.


1166
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.704
You must give me your recipe.


1167
01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:21.006
It's a first for rabbit.


1168
01:15:21.344 --> 01:15:22.869
It's not rabbit, it's cat!


1169
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.505
Watch your step, Simon.


1170
01:15:26.317 --> 01:15:26.976
Isn't it Gerard?


1171
01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:30.980
The idiot makes things up.


1172
01:15:31.322 --> 01:15:32.310
I'm not an idiot.


1173
01:15:32.488 --> 01:15:36.686
Don't give me orders. Who do you
think you are? I've had it!


1174
01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.259
You called me Simon!


1175
01:15:38.429 --> 01:15:39.487
Don't talk back!


1176
01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:42.393
- I've had enough of your yelling.
- Me, too.


1177
01:15:42.565 --> 01:15:43.760
When I find my father...


1178
01:15:44.967 --> 01:15:47.027
I hate you! You're a big fat idiot!


1179
01:15:48.639 --> 01:15:49.264
Want another?


1180
01:15:50.306 --> 01:15:51.364
Brat!


1181
01:15:54.645 --> 01:15:57.704
Don't listen to Gerard.
It's rabbit, not cat.


1182
01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.472
That's not why she's crying.


1183
01:16:00.818 --> 01:16:02.444
Don't you start.


1184
01:16:04.887 --> 01:16:05.945
She's exhausted.


1185
01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:08.180
Come on, Colette.


1186
01:16:12.595 --> 01:16:15.587
I'll tell Sarah to come up.


1187
01:16:17.735 --> 01:16:19.327
Stay with me.


1188
01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:35.416
Sometimes I slap Martin, too.


1189
01:16:35.586 --> 01:16:38.487
That doesn't mean
I don't love him.


1190
01:16:38.655 --> 01:16:41.283
Your brother doesn't seem
easy to handle.


1191
01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:43.221
He's not my brother.


1192
01:16:45.996 --> 01:16:48.726
I said he was my father
to trick the enemy.


1193
01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:50.367
- Who is he?
- A goy.


1194
01:16:50.534 --> 01:16:52.833
- A what?
- In yourterms, a non-Jew.


1195
01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:55.636
He's a neighbor.
His name's Batignole.


1196
01:16:55.806 --> 01:16:58.434
My parents were arrested
because of him.


1197
01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:01.243
What's that?


1198
01:17:02.746 --> 01:17:03.872
A smoke. Want some?


1199
01:17:09.453 --> 01:17:09.920
It's strong.


1200
01:17:10.688 --> 01:17:11.881
You were saying...


1201
01:17:13.992 --> 01:17:14.889
About Batifiole?


1202
01:17:15.226 --> 01:17:18.787
"Batignole." He stole our apartment.
He's got our money.


1203
01:17:19.297 --> 01:17:20.286
Did he steal a lot?


1204
01:17:20.698 --> 01:17:22.597
He's got 130,000 francs in his bag.
I counted it.


1205
01:17:22.766 --> 01:17:27.261
He'll probably lose you
in the mountains and keep the money.


1206
01:17:28.472 --> 01:17:29.940
Take another hit.
It's not so bad.


1207
01:17:34.045 --> 01:17:35.306
Go on.


1208
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.340
When I got home,
he had the SS there.


1209
01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:43.212
Last month, a guy like him
was dealing with the Krauts.


1210
01:17:43.454 --> 01:17:44.819
He was strung up by his feet,


1211
01:17:44.988 --> 01:17:47.822
they cut off his wee-wee
and let him bleed.


1212
01:17:47.992 --> 01:17:49.425
Who killed him?


1213
01:17:49.594 --> 01:17:52.619
- The guys in the Resistance.
- Of course.


1214
01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:55.698
Do you even know
what the Resistance is?


1215
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:58.029
They kill people.


1216
01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:00.769
Not just anybody.
The Krauts.


1217
01:18:00.939 --> 01:18:02.963
Or other scum.
Like your so-called father.


1218
01:18:03.307 --> 01:18:04.969
Know anyone in the Resistance?


1219
01:18:05.309 --> 01:18:06.173
Plenty.


1220
01:18:06.577 --> 01:18:07.407
Do they have guns?


1221
01:18:07.878 --> 01:18:09.938
A lot.
They come from America.


1222
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:10.746
What do they have?


1223
01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:12.471
Machine guns and canons.


1224
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:13.274
What about planes?


1225
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.643
Planes and tanks.


1226
01:18:14.818 --> 01:18:16.342
How do you know?


1227
01:18:17.454 --> 01:18:19.479
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.


1228
01:18:19.657 --> 01:18:22.592
My brother.
He's one of the head guys.


1229
01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:26.661
He's gonna kick the Krauts
out of France and free my father.


1230
01:18:26.898 --> 01:18:27.626
My parents, too?


1231
01:18:27.798 --> 01:18:31.360
Yeah, but first we have to kill
bastards like Batignole.


1232
01:18:31.636 --> 01:18:34.264
We need him to help us
go to Switzerland.


1233
01:18:38.809 --> 01:18:40.505
My brother can take you.


1234
01:18:47.385 --> 01:18:49.751
Those are my dad's glasses.


1235
01:18:50.854 --> 01:18:52.583
They're getting some use.


1236
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.224
Night, Mom.


1237
01:18:56.594 --> 01:18:57.583
Good night.


1238
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:59.755
- You smoked.
- I didn't.


1239
01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:02.797
Liar! I can smell it a mile away.
Up to bed.


1240
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.699
Good night, son.


1241
01:19:07.704 --> 01:19:09.297
Kids aren't easy.


1242
01:19:11.576 --> 01:19:14.373
The girls don't give me
too much trouble.


1243
01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:18.680
The boy's causing me grief.


1244
01:19:18.851 --> 01:19:20.546
I shouldn't have slapped him.


1245
01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:22.880
- He'll live.
- You're right.


1246
01:19:23.922 --> 01:19:26.220
- How can I say...
- I know.


1247
01:19:26.891 --> 01:19:28.722
They're not your kids.


1248
01:19:29.228 --> 01:19:31.253
It was just by chance.


1249
01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:35.190
You're very courageous.


1250
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.496
That was by chance, too.


1251
01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:38.931
But here I am.


1252
01:19:42.608 --> 01:19:44.599
I have laundry to take in.


1253
01:19:57.255 --> 01:19:58.985
That's dry.


1254
01:20:01.627 --> 01:20:04.824
Into the basket.
That's dry.


1255
01:20:04.996 --> 01:20:06.793
That's dry.


1256
01:20:07.032 --> 01:20:08.556
And that?


1257
01:20:25.016 --> 01:20:26.746
Martin, I just wanted to say...


1258
01:20:27.085 --> 01:20:29.384
Batignole did help us, too.


1259
01:20:30.422 --> 01:20:32.048
Once a bastard, always a bastard!


1260
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.255
Don't let yourself get mushy.


1261
01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.422
Tomorrow we'll see my brother
in Bizot,


1262
01:20:37.595 --> 01:20:40.394
and by noon,
Batignole will be strung up.


1263
01:20:47.039 --> 01:20:48.630
Look Daddy, I found a snail.


1264
01:20:48.806 --> 01:20:51.798
Wonderful.
Did you sleep well girls?


1265
01:20:52.077 --> 01:20:53.873
No. Simon threw up all over.


1266
01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:55.569
I'll see how he's doing.


1267
01:20:55.747 --> 01:20:57.681
He left with Martin this morning.


1268
01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.043
I told him not to leave.


1269
01:20:59.385 --> 01:21:00.043
I said that, too.


1270
01:21:00.386 --> 01:21:01.909
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.


1271
01:21:02.253 --> 01:21:03.983
Simon took your bag with the money.


1272
01:21:05.023 --> 01:21:07.652
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Where were you?


1273
01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:08.587
Where did you sleep?


1274
01:21:11.563 --> 01:21:14.622
I slept outside.
Why didn't you dummies tell me?


1275
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.268
- I'll see if they're any eggs.
- Me too.


1276
01:21:17.435 --> 01:21:21.600
- Stop copying me.
- What you do is so interesting.


1277
01:21:22.306 --> 01:21:25.275
Did you and your cousins
come alone from Paris?


1278
01:21:25.443 --> 01:21:26.034
No.


1279
01:21:26.378 --> 01:21:29.346
They came with some guy
named Batignole.


1280
01:21:29.514 --> 01:21:31.574
He's a lowlife collaborator.


1281
01:21:31.783 --> 01:21:33.411
Tell him what you said last night.


1282
01:21:34.552 --> 01:21:36.020
Did you kill a collaborator?


1283
01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:39.951
That's what you told me.


1284
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:40.951
Is it true or not?


1285
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.425
Back to business.
What do you have?


1286
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.655
Not much.


1287
01:21:46.398 --> 01:21:47.626
You said you had 130,000 francs.


1288
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.061
I need some for later.


1289
01:21:50.068 --> 01:21:51.467
How about 50,000?


1290
01:21:54.505 --> 01:21:55.268
For my cousins too?


1291
01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.505
Yeah. Is it a deal?


1292
01:21:59.677 --> 01:22:01.077
And you kill Batignole?


1293
01:22:01.345 --> 01:22:01.970
Don't bother.


1294
01:22:02.314 --> 01:22:03.246
He's a bastard.


1295
01:22:03.414 --> 01:22:06.542
Pierre-Jean was the real bastard.
He was the collaborator.


1296
01:22:07.252 --> 01:22:10.244
Batignole killed him.
He's part of the Resistance, too.


1297
01:22:10.422 --> 01:22:11.649
Last night you agreed.


1298
01:22:11.923 --> 01:22:13.448
Last night I was schlamiel.


1299
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.621
That means I was stupid.


1300
01:22:16.862 --> 01:22:20.697
Last Yom Kippur, I smoked, I drank
and I danced on the table.


1301
01:22:21.467 --> 01:22:23.958
It was the same last night.
I smoked yourthing.


1302
01:22:24.336 --> 01:22:25.895
I was just babbling.


1303
01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.671
Batignole's a nice guy.


1304
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:30.537
Not a lot of French help us.
They denounce us.


1305
01:22:30.777 --> 01:22:32.539
I gotta go.
Come on.


1306
01:22:32.878 --> 01:22:34.574
Come with me!


1307
01:22:34.747 --> 01:22:36.045
You stay. We don't know you.


1308
01:22:36.782 --> 01:22:38.751
French police. Come with me.


1309
01:22:40.853 --> 01:22:41.752
Not so fast.


1310
01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:45.313
What do we have here?


1311
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.587
Who's that guy?


1312
01:22:48.762 --> 01:22:50.695
- A spy.
- Where's he taking him?


1313
01:22:50.863 --> 01:22:52.694
- To the cops.
- Do something.


1314
01:22:53.466 --> 01:22:54.592
What can I do?


1315
01:22:54.768 --> 01:22:56.030
You're part of the resistance.


1316
01:22:56.369 --> 01:22:58.564
You want me to attack
with Dad's rifle?


1317
01:22:58.737 --> 01:23:00.706
You said you had machine guns.


1318
01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:02.363
We're just getting started!


1319
01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:05.237
At Deedee's party,
you said you had tanks.


1320
01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:06.639
I was drunk.


1321
01:23:06.813 --> 01:23:09.246
- I told Simon.
- You shouldn't have.


1322
01:23:09.414 --> 01:23:12.247
- I look like an idiot!
- Go home and forget it.


1323
01:23:13.019 --> 01:23:14.680
You asshole!


1324
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:16.582
Edmond, hurry!


1325
01:23:17.756 --> 01:23:18.724
What's going on?


1326
01:23:18.891 --> 01:23:23.226
My cousin's chief of police in Bizot.
Simon's at the station.


1327
01:23:23.396 --> 01:23:24.521
- What's he doing there?
- I don't know.


1328
01:23:24.697 --> 01:23:27.666
Bring his papers.
They want to check them.


1329
01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:29.028
Thanks.


1330
01:23:30.036 --> 01:23:33.005
- Can I borrow your car?
- If you can find gas.


1331
01:23:45.351 --> 01:23:47.911
You think it's clever
to take your father's money.


1332
01:23:48.086 --> 01:23:49.884
Why did you take it?


1333
01:23:50.056 --> 01:23:51.421
I don't know.


1334
01:23:51.591 --> 01:23:54.320
- Who were you giving it to?
- Nobody.


1335
01:23:54.494 --> 01:23:56.018
So you were stealing it!


1336
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:59.292
Here's the kid I told you about.


1337
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.393
What's your name?


1338
01:24:02.568 --> 01:24:03.899
Gerard Louvier.


1339
01:24:04.237 --> 01:24:05.533
He's a good kid.


1340
01:24:06.505 --> 01:24:08.735
- I'll leave you.
- Thanks.


1341
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.806
- Hands made for the piano.
- I play violin.


1342
01:24:18.518 --> 01:24:21.543
I got an award at the Conservatory
in Mrs. Rosenfeld's class.


1343
01:24:23.856 --> 01:24:25.585
I've been with her for 5 years.


1344
01:24:25.891 --> 01:24:26.984
Is your dad a musician?


1345
01:24:27.594 --> 01:24:30.324
He owns the Batignole butcher shop.


1346
01:24:30.496 --> 01:24:32.987
He was catering for German officers.


1347
01:24:33.398 --> 01:24:33.989
A collaborator?


1348
01:24:34.333 --> 01:24:35.391
A real one.


1349
01:24:43.775 --> 01:24:44.935
Is that your father's name?


1350
01:24:45.344 --> 01:24:45.969
No. Louvier.


1351
01:24:46.512 --> 01:24:48.604
The Batignoles are the old owners.


1352
01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.238
My father's name is Louvier.
Edmond Louvier. Rue Sivel.


1353
01:24:52.784 --> 01:24:54.514
We're on vacation here.


1354
01:24:54.686 --> 01:24:58.452
They're staying with my cousin.
They come once a year.


1355
01:24:59.826 --> 01:25:00.850
They're good people.


1356
01:25:02.262 --> 01:25:03.228
Daddy!


1357
01:25:03.762 --> 01:25:06.323
- What are you doing?
- I'll tell you later.


1358
01:25:06.498 --> 01:25:07.966
You really scared me, Gerard.


1359
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:08.923
He's a menace.


1360
01:25:09.735 --> 01:25:13.434
Kids, you never know
what gets into their heads.


1361
01:25:13.806 --> 01:25:14.568
Let's go.


1362
01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:16.470
Hold on.


1363
01:25:16.877 --> 01:25:18.868
- May I see his papers?
- Of course.


1364
01:25:19.046 --> 01:25:20.740
- Wait for me outside.
- No.


1365
01:25:24.717 --> 01:25:25.742
Thanks.


1366
01:25:29.556 --> 01:25:31.614
- And yours?
- I wasn't told to bring them.


1367
01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:32.815
He's my father.


1368
01:25:32.993 --> 01:25:35.426
The resemblance isn't striking.


1369
01:25:35.595 --> 01:25:37.655
He's the image of his mother.


1370
01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:39.492
My wife died last year.


1371
01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:42.658
I know them.
They go to my cousin's every year.


1372
01:25:42.936 --> 01:25:45.996
For their health.
Does your cousin know Jews?


1373
01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:50.007
- We're not Jewish.
- Your son was stopped in a cafï¿½,


1374
01:25:50.344 --> 01:25:52.539
because he was talking
in Jewish terms,


1375
01:25:52.979 --> 01:25:54.503
where he was acting like a fool.


1376
01:25:54.815 --> 01:25:55.746
What were you doing?


1377
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:58.916
Answer Simon!


1378
01:25:59.085 --> 01:26:01.280
- Simon?
- His second name.


1379
01:26:01.454 --> 01:26:02.819
A Jewish name.


1380
01:26:03.489 --> 01:26:05.788
- I didn't know that.
- And "schlemiel"?


1381
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.291
Schlamiel is German for jerk.


1382
01:26:08.996 --> 01:26:11.226
He must've heard it
at a German party.


1383
01:26:11.398 --> 01:26:13.729
I organize buffets.
I'm a butcher.


1384
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.201
I told you he worked with Germans.


1385
01:26:16.737 --> 01:26:18.431
With the French, too.


1386
01:26:18.604 --> 01:26:21.300
I have a buffet for200 people
coming up.


1387
01:26:21.475 --> 01:26:23.408
High-level administration people.


1388
01:26:30.717 --> 01:26:32.514
Wait in here.


1389
01:26:34.655 --> 01:26:37.590
One last question.
Does your son play music?


1390
01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:38.824
Absolutely.


1391
01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:40.418
What instrument?


1392
01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.485
The violin.


1393
01:26:42.396 --> 01:26:45.023
He's constantly bending
our ears with it.


1394
01:26:45.565 --> 01:26:47.261
- No talent?
- You said it.


1395
01:26:47.434 --> 01:26:49.698
He said he was
at the top of his class.


1396
01:26:50.069 --> 01:26:51.867
A small local school.


1397
01:26:52.539 --> 01:26:56.305
I preferred the accordion,
but since his mother's a violinist.


1398
01:26:56.676 --> 01:26:57.301
Isn't she dead?


1399
01:26:59.078 --> 01:27:01.444
Isn't your wife dead?


1400
01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.283
It's as if she's still alive for me.


1401
01:27:06.253 --> 01:27:08.278
Such a wonderful woman.


1402
01:27:09.355 --> 01:27:10.880
You know the way life is.


1403
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:13.657
His teacher's name?


1404
01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.621
Your son's violin teacher's name.


1405
01:27:16.797 --> 01:27:18.423
What does that mean?


1406
01:27:18.599 --> 01:27:20.567
Why don't you have him
drop his pants!


1407
01:27:20.934 --> 01:27:23.561
You're clever
and like all businessmen.


1408
01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:26.534
You probably have
all the right certificates


1409
01:27:26.707 --> 01:27:28.765
indicating he's had an operation.


1410
01:27:29.909 --> 01:27:32.639
What I want to know,
since he's your kid,


1411
01:27:33.914 --> 01:27:36.882
is the violin teacher's name
he's had for 5 years.


1412
01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:39.613
You must know it.


1413
01:27:40.987 --> 01:27:44.445
I knew the French police were bad,
but it's beyond belief.


1414
01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:45.488
That's your answer?


1415
01:27:48.694 --> 01:27:51.755
I just sold my shop. I've got cash.
130,000 francs.


1416
01:27:51.931 --> 01:27:55.368
Take it.
That's my only response.


1417
01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:59.301
You sold your business, but you're
catering for200 in a week?


1418
01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:01.873
You're implying Jews are liars?


1419
01:28:04.444 --> 01:28:07.470
I've heard that for years,
been subjected to it.


1420
01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:10.407
The kikes do this,
the kikes do that.


1421
01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:13.815
First they took away my phone,
then the radio.


1422
01:28:13.987 --> 01:28:16.422
I wasn't allowed to work.


1423
01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:19.389
Then I had to wear a star,
but that wasn't enough.


1424
01:28:19.726 --> 01:28:23.184
The French police took my wife,
my brothers, my cousins.


1425
01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:26.355
They gave my apartment
to a French couple.


1426
01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.862
My furniture was seized,
all I owned was stolen.


1427
01:28:31.338 --> 01:28:34.331
I sold a small painting
to get this money.


1428
01:28:34.675 --> 01:28:37.770
Apart from my kids,
it was the only thing of value.


1429
01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:40.346
I'm not a butcher.


1430
01:28:40.514 --> 01:28:42.744
I'm a doctor, a surgeon.


1431
01:28:43.784 --> 01:28:45.684
I saved tons of idiots like you.


1432
01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.583
I served in the French army
to help liberate my country.


1433
01:28:49.756 --> 01:28:52.225
So that you could live freely.


1434
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.918
We've been here for 50 years.


1435
01:28:55.896 --> 01:28:58.729
I've been a law-abiding citizen,
paid my taxes.


1436
01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:02.300
The State uses my taxes
to pay salaries for people like you.


1437
01:29:02.703 --> 01:29:04.637
And this is the thanks I get?


1438
01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:08.369
You treat me like a sub-human.
Who's the sub-human here?


1439
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:11.175
Call the Commandant.


1440
01:29:11.712 --> 01:29:12.337
But, Lieutenant.


1441
01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:12.912
Do it!


1442
01:29:13.747 --> 01:29:14.442
Hands up!


1443
01:29:14.815 --> 01:29:15.543
Get your hands up!


1444
01:29:18.819 --> 01:29:19.787
Hey, mister!


1445
01:29:23.557 --> 01:29:24.957
Are you alright?


1446
01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:51.907
What are we doing here?


1447
01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:54.311
For the love of God, keep quiet.


1448
01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:03.220
Father. You're supposed
to help us cross the border.


1449
01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:05.365
I know. Wait a moment.


1450
01:30:05.532 --> 01:30:08.228
- He's taking us?
- Were you expecting a rabbi?


1451
01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:10.996
- What happened?
- Problems. We've got to go.


1452
01:30:11.338 --> 01:30:12.931
Irene spoke of 2 other girls.


1453
01:30:13.273 --> 01:30:17.505
They're at the farm. I'll warn them.
I'll get them. I don't know.


1454
01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.771
Calm down. Hide in here.


1455
01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:29.518
- Gentlemen?
- Good evening.


1456
01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:32.655
Seen anything unusual?
A man with a mustache,


1457
01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:35.387
balding, around 50, with a child.


1458
01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:38.827
I haven't seen a soul
since confession. What did he do?


1459
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.489
He's a Jew.


1460
01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:41.992
With his son.


1461
01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:43.702
Sorry I can't help you.


1462
01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:45.800
Good evening, Father.


1463
01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.073
- Sorry to bother you.
- Don't worry.


1464
01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.681
It's OK.
Stay here until it calms down.


1465
01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:58.512
Then go to the farm
and I'll get you in the morning.


1466
01:30:58.685 --> 01:31:00.050
- Excuse me, Father.
- Yes.


1467
01:31:00.387 --> 01:31:01.684
I hope Irene won't have problems.


1468
01:31:01.855 --> 01:31:04.221
Don't worry. I'll lock you in.


1469
01:31:06.693 --> 01:31:07.956
Why did you go into town?


1470
01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:09.831
I don't know.


1471
01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:10.764
What about the money?


1472
01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:14.693
Martin said you wanted
to stay with his mother.


1473
01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:17.737
I thought I had to find
someone else to help us.


1474
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.965
You're crazy, Simon.


1475
01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:24.609
I can't wait to get you
to Switzerland.


1476
01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:27.680
I'm thirsty.


1477
01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:54.907
We found nobody.


1478
01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:56.771
Same here, chief.


1479
01:31:59.782 --> 01:32:01.340
Watch your step.


1480
01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.951
Was I supposed to know
they were Jews?


1481
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.614
Am I to be hung
for renting 2 rooms?


1482
01:32:10.326 --> 01:32:12.987
The law is the law
and ignorance isn't acceptable.


1483
01:32:18.934 --> 01:32:19.559
Night, Irene.


1484
01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:20.967
Good night.


1485
01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:39.619
The imbecile's gone.
Now we wait for the Father.


1486
01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.286
Are you alright?


1487
01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:43.921
They're sleeping.


1488
01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:48.021
I'm hungry. Any rabbit left?


1489
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:49.255
Yes.


1490
01:32:52.434 --> 01:32:53.730
Let's get going.


1491
01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.597
See you later.


1492
01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:56.996
Bye, Martin.


1493
01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:58.472
Bye, girls.


1494
01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.436
Good-bye, Irene.


1495
01:33:00.609 --> 01:33:01.541
Bye, Martin.


1496
01:33:03.779 --> 01:33:05.371
Have a safe trip.


1497
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:06.806
Bye.


1498
01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:11.386
This is for your brother,
so he can buy a tank.


1499
01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:15.253
We've got to go.


1500
01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:18.893
Bye.


1501
01:34:00.869 --> 01:34:01.460
This is it.


1502
01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:04.530
You're in Switzerland.


1503
01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:05.603
We made it!


1504
01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:06.569
Listen carefully.


1505
01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:10.206
Go to that house.
Mr. Blanchard knows you're coming.


1506
01:34:10.612 --> 01:34:12.706
He'll take you to the next village.


1507
01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.916
Then to the Red Cross
in Lausanne. You're safe now.


1508
01:34:16.685 --> 01:34:17.845
See, I worked it all out.


1509
01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:21.854
This is good-bye Guila.


1510
01:34:22.826 --> 01:34:24.259
Good-bye Sarah.


1511
01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:29.988
Good-bye Simon.


1512
01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:31.458
Thank you, Edmond.


1513
01:34:32.735 --> 01:34:33.929
I should thank you.


1514
01:34:35.604 --> 01:34:38.005
Get going.
They'll be patrolling the area.


1515
01:34:39.309 --> 01:34:40.570
Take this.


1516
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:42.271
Take care.


1517
01:34:50.286 --> 01:34:52.014
Go on!


1518
01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:53.753
Let's go.


1519
01:34:57.494 --> 01:34:59.552
Go ahead.
Don't wait for me.


1520
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:02.395
Thanks, Father.


1521
01:35:04.734 --> 01:35:07.259
- Are you coming?
- Yes, I was thinking...


1522
01:35:07.770 --> 01:35:09.703
You need help with the language.


1523
01:35:10.472 --> 01:35:14.466
You speak German, English
and Russian, but not Swiss.


1524
01:35:14.644 --> 01:35:15.940
They speak French.


1525
01:35:16.279 --> 01:35:19.247
- No, they speak Swiss.
- What does it sound like?


1526
01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:21.679
It sounds like "Theese."


1527
01:35:21.851 --> 01:35:22.943
How do you say hello?


1528
01:35:23.286 --> 01:35:26.653
Hello, you say "Haylooo."


1529
01:35:26.823 --> 01:35:29.791
And a car, that's a "karrre."


1530
01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:31.016
